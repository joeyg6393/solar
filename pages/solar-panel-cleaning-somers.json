 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should I clean my solar panels in Somers, CT?",
   "answer": "Somers solar systems typically benefit from professional cleaning 2-3 times per year due to the area's rural environment. We recommend spring cleaning (to remove winter debris and tree pollen), summer cleaning (for dust and agricultural particulates), and fall cleaning (before winter weather). Properties with significant tree coverage, near farms, or exposed to Route 190 traffic may require more frequent service. We'll assess your specific Somers location and provide a customized maintenance schedule."
  },
  {
   "question": "What efficiency improvement can I expect from solar panel cleaning in Somers?",
   "answer": "Somers solar owners typically see 15-25% efficiency improvement after professional cleaning. Rural environmental factors like tree pollen, agricultural dust, bird droppings, and seasonal debris significantly block sunlight and reduce energy production. Our cleaning restores panels to 95-100% of their rated capacity, which means immediate increases in daily energy production and utility savings. We provide documentation showing your specific performance improvement."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional solar panel cleaning necessary in Somers?",
   "answer": "Yes - professional cleaning is essential for maximizing your solar ROI in Somers. The rural environment means panels accumulate pollen, agricultural dust, and organic debris faster than urban areas. Dirty panels losing 20% efficiency cost the average Somers homeowner $200-400+ annually in lost energy production. Our $150-400 cleaning service restores that production, paying for itself within months. Plus, regular maintenance extends panel lifespan and prevents costly repairs, protecting your entire solar investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I safely clean my own solar panels in Somers?",
   "answer": "While ground-mount panels can be cleaned by homeowners, rooftop systems require professional service. We strongly recommend professional cleaning for Somers residents because: (1) Rooftop work requires proper safety equipment and training, (2) Incorrect cleaning methods or products can void warranties and damage panels, (3) Professionals identify potential problems during inspection, and (4) We carry full liability insurance protecting your property. The safety risks and potential damage from DIY cleaning far outweigh the cost of professional service."
  },
  {
   "question": "What cleaning methods do you use on Somers solar panels?",
   "answer": "We use only manufacturer-approved cleaning methods for Somers solar installations: deionized water (prevents mineral deposits and water spots), biodegradable eco-friendly solutions safe for Connecticut environment and rural properties, and specialized soft brushes designed specifically for solar panels. We never use pressure washers, abrasive materials, or harsh chemicals that could damage anti-reflective coatings, create micro-scratches, or harm your landscaping. Our methods are proven safe, effective, and warranty-compliant."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you clean ground-mount solar systems in Somers?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We service all types of solar installations in Somers including rooftop residential systems, ground-mount arrays, agricultural solar installations, and commercial systems. Ground-mount systems are common in rural Somers and require regular cleaning due to lower placement and increased exposure to dust, debris, and vegetation. We have specialized equipment and procedures for safely cleaning ground-mount systems, and we can handle installations of any size."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will professional cleaning void my solar panel warranty?",
   "answer": "No - professional cleaning using proper methods maintains and protects warranty coverage. We use only manufacturer-approved cleaning techniques and products that comply with all warranty requirements. In fact, many solar panel warranties require regular maintenance, and neglecting to clean your panels could potentially void your warranty coverage. We provide detailed service documentation proving proper maintenance for warranty compliance purposes."
  },
  {
   "question": "What else do you inspect during solar panel cleaning in Somers?",
   "answer": "Our Somers cleaning service includes a comprehensive system inspection at no additional charge. We check for: physical damage or micro-cracks in panels, loose or corroded mounting hardware, compromised weatherproof seals, vegetation overgrowth or debris accumulation, inverter performance and error codes, wiring connections and conduit integrity, and potential shading from tree growth. We document all findings with photographs and provide detailed recommendations, helping you maintain optimal performance and avoid expensive future repairs."
