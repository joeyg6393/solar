 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does solar battery storage cost in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "Tesla Powerwall installation in East Longmeadow typically costs $12,400-$16,800 before benefits. After applying the federal solar financing and Massachusetts rebates, your net investment is approximately $9,200-$12,400. Most East Longmeadow residents install 1-2 Powerwalls based on their backup needs and home size. We provide free detailed quotes and attractive financing with $0 down."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will battery storage work during East Longmeadow's winter storms?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar battery storage is specifically engineered to provide backup power during East Longmeadow's winter storms and ice events. When the grid goes down, your battery automatically powers your home's critical circuits. With proper sizing, a Tesla Powerwall can keep essential systems running for 24+ hours, and it recharges when your solar panels produce energy or when grid power returns."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add batteries to my existing East Longmeadow solar system?",
   "answer": "Yes! Battery storage can be retrofitted to virtually any existing solar panel system in East Longmeadow. Whether your solar installation is 1 year old or 15 years old, we can integrate battery storage seamlessly. The retrofit process involves installing the battery unit, potentially upgrading your inverter, and updating electrical connections. Most East Longmeadow retrofit installations take 1-2 days."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long will a battery power my East Longmeadow home?",
   "answer": "One Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits in a typical East Longmeadow home for 24-36 hours during an outage, including lights, refrigerator, internet, heating controls, and select outlets. For whole-home backup including HVAC and major appliances, most homes need 2-3 Powerwalls. We'll calculate your specific backup duration during our free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "East Longmeadow homeowners qualify for the flexible financing options on battery storage when paired with solar panels. You can also participate in Massachusetts' ConnectedSolutions program, earning $225-$375 annually per Powerwall. Combined with substantial energy savings through time-of-use optimization, battery storage delivers excellent financial returns."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "Physical installation of solar battery storage in East Longmeadow takes 1-2 days for most residential projects. The complete process from initial consultation to system activation typically spans 3-4 weeks, including custom design, permitting with the Town of East Longmeadow, Eversource interconnection approval, installation, and final inspection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Tesla Powerwall vs Enphase IQ Battery - which is better?",
   "answer": "Both are excellent choices for East Longmeadow homes! Tesla Powerwall offers 13.5 kWh per unit in a proven all-in-one design - ideal for most residential applications. Enphase IQ Battery provides modular flexibility (start with 3.3 kWh, expand later) and integrates perfectly with Enphase microinverters. We'll recommend the best option based on your existing solar setup, backup needs, and budget during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will battery storage increase my East Longmeadow home's value?",
   "answer": "Yes! Research consistently shows that solar + battery storage systems increase home values by 4-6% in Massachusetts. East Longmeadow homebuyers increasingly prioritize energy independence and backup power capability, especially after experiencing storm-related outages. Your battery system transfers to future owners with remaining warranty coverage, making it a valuable selling feature."
