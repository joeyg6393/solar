 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How important is regular solar panel maintenance in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Extremely important. Stafford's rural location means more exposure to pollen, tree debris, and agricultural dust that reduce panel efficiency. Regular maintenance removes these contaminants, identifies developing issues, and ensures optimal performance. Proper maintenance can boost energy production by 15-25% and extend your system's productive life by 5-10 years, making it one of the best investments in your solar system."
  },
  {
   "question": "What should I do if my solar panels aren't producing as much energy?",
   "answer": "Contact us for a professional diagnostic assessment. Reduced production can result from dirty panels, failing inverters, electrical issues, shading problems, or component degradation. Our Stafford technicians use advanced testing equipment to identify the exact cause and provide solutions. Many issues are simple fixes when caught early but can become expensive if ignored."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you repair solar panels damaged by Connecticut storms?",
   "answer": "Yes, we handle all types of storm damage including cracked or broken panels, damaged mounting systems, disconnected wiring, and inverter damage from power surges. We can document damage for insurance claims and work with your insurance provider. Our emergency service team responds quickly to secure your Stafford system and prevent further damage."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I really need professional cleaning or can I clean panels myself?",
   "answer": "While basic rinsing can help, professional cleaning is strongly recommended. We use purified water systems and specialized techniques that prevent damage to panel coatings while achieving superior results. More importantly, our service includes comprehensive electrical and structural inspections that identify problems you can't safely detect yourself. DIY cleaning also involves rooftop safety risks."
  },
  {
   "question": "How often should I schedule solar maintenance in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Annual professional maintenance is recommended for most Stafford systems. Properties with heavy tree coverage, agricultural exposure, or significant bird activity may benefit from semi-annual service. Connecticut's seasonal challenges - spring pollen, summer storms, fall leaves, and winter conditions - make regular professional maintenance especially valuable for sustained peak performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "What brands of solar equipment can you service?",
   "answer": "We service all major solar panel brands (SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, REC, Panasonic, Hanwha Q CELLS, etc.) and all inverter types (string inverters from SMA, Fronius, SolarEdge; microinverters from Enphase and APsystems; and hybrid/battery inverters). Our technicians receive ongoing manufacturer training and we maintain relationships for technical support and genuine replacement parts."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the cost difference between maintenance and waiting for repairs?",
   "answer": "Annual maintenance in Stafford costs $299-$649 depending on system size. Compare that to common repair costs: inverter replacement $2,000-$5,000, panel replacement $800-$1,500 per panel, electrical repairs $500-$1,500. Maintenance typically pays for itself through increased energy production while preventing much more expensive repair bills. It's far more cost-effective to maintain than repair."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if your service is working?",
   "answer": "We provide measurable results. After service, you'll receive a detailed report showing your system's current performance compared to expected output. Most Stafford customers see noticeable increases in daily energy production after professional cleaning and maintenance. We also monitor system performance over time to ensure sustained optimal operation and can compare production data before and after service."
