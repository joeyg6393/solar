We assess your home's electrical capacity, recommend any necessary upgrades, and ensure your installation meets all Palmer and Massachusetts electrical codes.\n\nPalmer homeowners who install Level 2 EV chargers enjoy the ultimate convenience of charging at home. Instead of driving to public charging stations in Springfield or along the Mass Pike, you simply plug in your vehicle when you arrive home and wake up to a full charge each morning.

For Palmer residents who commute to Springfield, Worcester, or work locally, home charging eliminates range anxiety and ensures you're always ready to drive.\n\nAs experienced solar installation professionals serving Palmer and Hampden County for over 12 years, we excel at integrating EV chargers with solar panel systems.
