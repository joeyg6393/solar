  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much space do I need for ground-mount solar in Wales?",
      "answer": "Most residential ground-mount systems (6-12 kW) in Wales require 600-2,400 square feet of land. The exact footprint depends on your energy consumption and desired system capacity. Our Wales team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is ground-mount solar suitable for Wales winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are specifically engineered for Massachusetts winters and western MA weather. They're designed to handle snow loads common in Wales and Hampden County. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing much easier than rooftop systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost for ground-mount solar in Wales?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Wales typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Wales homeowners see payback within 7-10 years with 25+ years of savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Wales?",
      "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations in Wales require building permits and must comply with local zoning including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Wales and Hampden County authorities, ensuring your system meets all Massachusetts codes and regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Wales?",
      "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Wales typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility is much greater than rooftop systems, ideal for growing Wales families and farms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Wales customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow."
