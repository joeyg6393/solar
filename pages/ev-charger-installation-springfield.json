 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How long does EV charger installation take in Springfield?",
   "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Springfield homes take 3-5 hours. This includes mounting the charger, running the dedicated 240V circuit from your electrical panel, and final testing. If electrical panel upgrades are needed, installation may take 6-8 hours. We'll provide an accurate timeline during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What EV charger brands do you install?",
   "answer": "We install all major Level 2 EV charger brands including Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox 40/48, Grizzl-E, Wallbox Pulsar Plus, Emporia, and ClipperCreek. We'll help you choose the best charger for your electric vehicle model, budget, and smart home integration preferences."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I qualify for EV charger financing options in Massachusetts?",
   "answer": "Yes! The federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit covers 30% of installation costs up to $1,000 for residential EV chargers. Massachusetts also offers MOR-EV benefits and potential utility company rebates. We help Springfield homeowners navigate all financing options to maximize savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can my Springfield home's electrical panel support an EV charger?",
   "answer": "Most modern Springfield homes can support Level 2 EV chargers, which require a dedicated 40-50 amp, 240V circuit. During our free consultation, we'll assess your electrical panel's capacity. If upgrades are needed, we handle the entire process including panel upgrades, permits, and inspections."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I install my EV charger indoors or outdoors?",
   "answer": "Both options work well in Springfield's climate. Indoor garage installations protect your charger and are convenient year-round. Outdoor installations use weatherproof chargers rated for Massachusetts winters. We'll recommend the best location based on your parking situation, electrical panel location, and budget."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I charge my EV with solar panels?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Pairing solar panels with home EV charging is one of the best ways to maximize savings and environmental benefits in Springfield. We design integrated solar and EV charging systems that can power your vehicle with 100% clean, renewable energy. This eliminates both gasoline and grid electricity costs."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does it cost to charge an EV at home in Springfield?",
   "answer": "With Springfield's average electricity rates around $0.22/kWh, fully charging a typical EV (60 kWh battery) costs about $13-15, providing 200-300 miles of range. That's equivalent to paying $1.50/gallon for gas! With solar panels, your charging costs drop to nearly zero. We can install smart chargers that schedule charging during off-peak hours for additional savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need a permit for EV charger installation in Springfield?",
   "answer": "Yes, Springfield requires electrical permits for Level 2 EV charger installations to ensure safety and code compliance. We handle all permitting, inspections, and paperwork as part of our installation service. Our licensed electricians ensure your installation meets all Massachusetts electrical codes and Springfield city requirements."
