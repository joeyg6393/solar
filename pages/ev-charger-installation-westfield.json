  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does EV charger installation cost in Westfield?",
      "answer": "EV charger installation in Westfield typically costs $900-$2,600 total. This includes the Level 2 charger ($400-$900), professional installation ($400-$900), and electrical work ($200-$800). The federal Alternative Fuel financing covers up to $1,000 of costs. We provide detailed free quotes specific to your Westfield home's requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What EV chargers work best in Westfield's climate?",
      "answer": "For Westfield's Massachusetts climate with cold winters and hot summers, we recommend durable chargers like Grizzl-E (rated -40°F to 122°F), ChargePoint Home Flex, and JuiceBox 48 for outdoor installations. These handle New England weather perfectly. For indoor garages, Tesla Wall Connector and Wallbox Pulsar Plus are excellent choices with smart features."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install an EV charger if I have solar panels in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Combining solar panels with EV charging is one of the smartest investments for Westfield homeowners. We design integrated systems where your solar panels generate electricity to power both your home and your electric vehicle, eliminating both utility bills and gasoline costs. This provides maximum return on investment and energy independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my Westfield home need electrical panel upgrades?",
      "answer": "It depends on your home's electrical panel capacity. Level 2 EV chargers require a dedicated 40-50 amp, 240V circuit. Newer Westfield homes (built after 1990) typically have sufficient capacity. Older homes may need panel upgrades, which we handle completely including permits and City of Westfield inspections. We provide free assessments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which EV charger brands do you recommend for Westfield?",
      "answer": "For Westfield homeowners, we recommend Tesla Wall Connector for Tesla vehicles, ChargePoint Home Flex for universal compatibility and smart features, JuiceBox 40/48 for WiFi connectivity and value, and Grizzl-E for outdoor installations. Each offers different features and price points. We'll help you choose the perfect charger during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast will my EV charge at home in Westfield?",
      "answer": "With a Level 2 charger in your Westfield home, you'll add 25-50 miles of range per hour - about 3-7x faster than a standard outlet. Most EVs fully charge overnight in 4-8 hours. A Tesla Model Y charges in about 7 hours, a Ford Mustang Mach-E in 8 hours, and a Chevy Bolt in 6-7 hours with a typical Level 2 charger."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for Westfield residents?",
      "answer": "Westfield residents qualify for the federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30% of costs up to $1,000). Massachusetts offers MOR-EV rebates for EV purchases, and some utility companies provide additional charger rebates. We help you navigate all financing options to maximize savings on your installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for EV charger installation in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Yes, the City of Westfield requires electrical permits for Level 2 EV charger installations to ensure safety and code compliance. We handle all permitting, inspections, and paperwork with the Westfield Building Department as part of our comprehensive installation service. Our licensed electricians ensure full compliance with all codes."
