We help you select the perfect charger from leading brands like Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox, Grizzl-E, and Wallbox Pulsar Plus. Our installations work flawlessly with all electric vehicles including Tesla Model 3/Y/X/S, Ford F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq, and every other EV on the market.\n\nGranby homeowners who install Level 2 EV chargers enjoy the ultimate convenience of home charging. Instead of driving to public charging stations in Amherst or South Hadley, you simply plug in your vehicle when you arrive home and wake up to a fully charged battery each morning. Our Level 2 chargers deliver 20-35 miles of range per hour of charging, allowing most electric vehicles to fully charge in 6-8 hours overnight.
