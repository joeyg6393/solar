 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What is the federal solar financing and how much can I save in Northampton?",
   "answer": "The federal Investment financing (financing) allows you to deduct of your solar installation cost through financing. For a typical Northampton solar system costing $25,000-$35,000, this means $6,500-$9,100 in financing savings. This credit applies to both purchased and financed systems, though not leased systems. Our consultation will show you exactly how to maximize this benefit."
  },
  {
   "question": "What Massachusetts-specific solar financing options are available for Northampton residents?",
   "answer": "Northampton residents can access the Massachusetts SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target) program, which provides per-kilowatt-hour production benefits for 10-20 years. You may also qualify for net metering (Solar Renewable Energy Credit) trading opportunities and net metering benefits through your utility company. Property tax exemptions for solar installations are also available. We'll help you navigate all applicable programs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I go solar with zero money down in Northampton?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We work with multiple lending partners offering zero-down solar loans specifically for Northampton homeowners. Many of our clients find their monthly loan payments are lower than their previous electric bills, resulting in immediate cash flow savings. We'll compare multiple $0-down options during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the difference between buying, leasing, and PPA for solar in Northampton?",
   "answer": "Buying (via cash or loan) means you own the system and receive all financings and benefits - typically the best long-term value. Leasing means you pay a fixed monthly fee to use the system but don't own it. A PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) means you buy the electricity the panels produce at a set rate. Our Northampton consultation will compare all three options with specific numbers for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does it take to pay off a solar system in Northampton?",
   "answer": "With current Massachusetts benefits and Northampton utility rates, most homeowners see payback periods of 6-10 years. After that, you enjoy free electricity for the remaining 15-20+ years of the system's life. Our financial analysis will show your specific payback timeline based on your energy usage, chosen financing, and financing options."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar financing affect my credit score?",
   "answer": "Initially, applying for solar financing will result in a credit inquiry, which may temporarily affect your score by a few points. However, making consistent on-time payments on your solar loan can actually improve your credit over time. Many of our Northampton clients have successfully financed solar with credit scores as low as 650, and we work with various lenders to find the best fit for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar financing if I sell my Northampton home?",
   "answer": "This depends on your financing type. If you own the system (cash or loan), it typically adds value to your home - studies show solar homes in Massachusetts sell for 4-6% more. You can pay off a loan from sale proceeds or transfer it to the buyer. Leases and PPAs can usually be transferred to the new homeowner. We'll discuss all implications during your consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I get started with a solar financing consultation in Northampton?",
   "answer": "Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or request a consultation through our website. We'll schedule a free, no-obligation meeting at your Northampton home or our office.
