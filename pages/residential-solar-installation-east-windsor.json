  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar panel installation cost in East Windsor, CT?",
      "answer": "Solar installation in East Windsor typically costs $15,800-$36,500 before benefits for a complete residential system. After the competitive pricing, your net investment ranges from $11,700-$27,000. System size depends on your energy consumption - most East Windsor homes need 6.5-11 kW systems. With zero-down financing, monthly solar payments are usually $90-$200 lower than current Eversource bills, creating immediate savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much will I save on electricity with solar in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "East Windsor homeowners save an average of $1,600-$2,500 annually on electricity after installing solar panels. Over 25 years, total savings typically exceed $50,000-$70,000 when accounting for Connecticut's high electricity rates and annual utility increases. Connecticut's net metering program maximizes savings by providing full retail credits for excess energy your system produces."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my East Windsor home suitable for solar panels?",
      "answer": "Most East Windsor homes are excellent candidates for solar! We can install on various roof types including asphalt shingle, metal, and tile. Ideal conditions include a roof with 15+ years remaining life, south or southwest orientation, and minimal shading. During your free consultation, we'll evaluate your specific property and can recommend ground-mount systems if rooftop installation isn't optimal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to install solar panels in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "The physical installation on your East Windsor home takes 1-3 days for most residential systems. The complete process from contract signing to system activation averages 6-10 weeks, including custom design, Town of East Windsor permit approval, equipment delivery, installation, inspection, and Eversource interconnection. We coordinate all steps and provide regular updates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels work during Connecticut winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels are highly efficient in cold weather - they need sunlight, not heat. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're engineered to shed snow naturally, and the dark surface helps accelerate melting. We design all East Windsor installations to handle Connecticut's heavy snow loads, ice, and wind, ensuring reliable year-round energy production."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar panels increase my East Windsor home's value?",
      "answer": "Yes! According to Zillow research, homes with solar panels sell for 4.1% more on average than comparable homes without solar. For a typical East Windsor home valued at $325,000, that represents approximately $13,000 in added value. Solar homes also tend to sell faster, benefiting you through current energy savings and future increased property value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties protect my East Windsor solar installation?",
      "answer": "Your East Windsor solar system includes comprehensive coverage: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels guaranteeing 80-85% production efficiency, 25-year manufacturer warranty on inverter equipment, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation quality, and lifetime warranty on roof waterproofing. We also guarantee your system will produce the projected energy. All warranties are fully transferable if you sell your home."
