 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often do solar panels need maintenance in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "We recommend annual professional maintenance for most East Windsor solar systems. Systems near agricultural areas, under heavy tree coverage, or experiencing significant bird activity may benefit from semi-annual service. Connecticut's climate - with spring pollen, summer storms, and winter weather - makes regular maintenance especially important for sustained peak performance and system longevity."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs my East Windsor solar system needs repair?",
   "answer": "Common warning signs include decreased energy production, monitoring system error messages, inverter warning lights or unusual sounds, visible panel damage or discoloration, loose mounting hardware, and unexpectedly high electric bills despite having solar. If you notice any of these issues with your East Windsor system, contact us for a free diagnostic evaluation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can dirty solar panels really reduce my energy production?",
   "answer": "Yes, significantly. Research shows that accumulated dirt, pollen, bird droppings, and environmental debris can reduce solar panel efficiency by 15-25% or more. In East Windsor, seasonal pollen from spring through summer and road dust are particularly problematic. Professional cleaning often pays for itself within months through increased energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service all types of solar equipment?",
   "answer": "Yes, our East Windsor technicians are trained and certified to service all major solar panel brands (SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, REC, Panasonic, etc.) and all inverter types including string inverters (SMA, Fronius, SolarEdge), microinverters (Enphase, APsystems), and hybrid inverters. We maintain manufacturer relationships for technical support and genuine parts."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your maintenance service?",
   "answer": "Our comprehensive East Windsor maintenance includes: professional panel cleaning with purified water, complete visual and electrical inspection, inverter performance testing and diagnostics, connection testing and tightening, mounting system structural check, monitoring system verification, performance measurement and comparison, thermal imaging (when needed), and a detailed service report with photos and recommendations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does solar panel maintenance cost?",
   "answer": "Basic residential maintenance in East Windsor starts at $175. Annual maintenance contracts offering the best value range from $299-$599 based on system size and service frequency. Many homeowners find annual plans cost-effective since the increased energy production often exceeds the service cost. We provide free assessments and transparent pricing."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency repair services?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide emergency repair services for urgent situations including storm damage, complete system failures, electrical hazards, and inverter malfunctions. We understand every day your East Windsor solar system is down means lost energy and higher costs. Our emergency team typically responds within 24 hours to diagnose issues and begin repairs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance help validate my solar panel warranty?",
   "answer": "Yes, most solar panel and inverter warranties require proof of regular professional maintenance to remain valid. We provide detailed service documentation for every maintenance visit, which you can submit to manufacturers if warranty claims become necessary. Proper maintenance also prevents many issues that would otherwise require warranty service or expensive out-of-pocket repairs."
