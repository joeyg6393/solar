  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in Longmeadow?",
      "answer": "Most Longmeadow residential systems require approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet of unshaded land for a typical 10kW installation. Given Longmeadow's larger lot sizes, most properties have ideal space available. Our consultation will identify the best placement that maximizes production while maintaining your property's aesthetics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will ground-mount solar affect my Longmeadow property's appearance?",
      "answer": "Not at all! We specialize in discreet placement that maintains Longmeadow's high aesthetic standards. Ground-mount systems can be positioned in back or side yards, often screened by landscaping. Many Longmeadow homeowners find ground-mount systems more aesthetically pleasing than rooftop installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required in Longmeadow?",
      "answer": "Longmeadow ground-mount installations require building permits from the Town Building Department and electrical permits. We have extensive experience with Longmeadow's permitting process and handle all applications, ensuring compliance with local standards and expediting approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Longmeadow?",
      "answer": "After permit approval, most Longmeadow residential ground-mount installations take 3-5 days to complete. The permitting process typically requires 4-8 weeks. We coordinate carefully to minimize disruption to your property and complete work to the highest standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems suitable for Longmeadow winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are engineered for New England weather. The elevated design allows snow to slide off naturally, and ground-level access makes any necessary snow removal simple. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations during Longmeadow's winter months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for Longmeadow solar installations?",
      "answer": "Longmeadow homeowners qualify for the competitive pricing, Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production incentive payments), and property assessment exemptions. These combined benefits can reduce your net system cost by 40-60%. We help you maximize all available benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ground-mount systems be expanded later?",
      "answer": "Yes! One of the advantages of ground-mount systems is easy expandability. We can design your initial Longmeadow installation with future expansion in mind, allowing you to add capacity as your family's energy needs or budget allows."
