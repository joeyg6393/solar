  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar battery storage cost in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Tesla Powerwall installation in Holyoke typically costs $12,000-$17,500 before benefits. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts benefits, your net cost is approximately $8,800-$13,000. Holyoke homeowners often choose 1-2 Powerwalls depending on home size and backup needs. We provide free detailed quotes and financing options with no money down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does battery storage work with Holyoke Gas & Electric?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We have extensive experience working with Holyoke Gas & Electric (HG&E) for solar and battery storage interconnections. HG&E has specific requirements for grid-tied battery systems, and we handle all coordination and paperwork. Battery storage can help you maximize savings with HG&E's rate structure through smart load shifting and time-of-use optimization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install battery storage in Holyoke's older historic homes?",
      "answer": "Yes! We specialize in installing battery storage in Holyoke's beautiful historic homes, including Victorian-era properties downtown and in the Churchill neighborhood. We assess your existing electrical system, upgrade panels if necessary, and install batteries safely in garages, basements, or on exterior walls while preserving your home's historic character."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will a battery power my Holyoke home during outages?",
      "answer": "One Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits in a typical Holyoke home for 24+ hours during an outage, including lights, refrigerator, internet, and select outlets. For whole-home backup including HVAC and major appliances, most Holyoke homes need 2-3 Powerwalls. During your free consultation, we'll calculate your specific backup duration based on your energy usage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options and financing options are available in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Holyoke residents qualify for the flexible financing options on battery storage when installed with solar panels. You can also participate in Massachusetts' ConnectedSolutions program, earning $225-$375 annually per Powerwall. Combined with energy savings through time-of-use rate optimization, battery storage becomes highly cost-effective."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add batteries to my existing solar panels in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Yes! Battery storage can be added to virtually any existing solar system in Holyoke, regardless of age or brand. We retrofit batteries to systems installed 1-15 years ago. The process involves adding the battery unit, potentially upgrading your inverter (depending on your current setup), and updating electrical connections. Most Holyoke retrofit installations take 1-2 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does battery storage installation take in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Physical installation of battery storage in Holyoke homes takes 1-2 days for most projects. The complete timeline from initial consultation to system activation is typically 3-4 weeks, including custom system design, permitting with the City of Holyoke, HG&E interconnection approval, installation, and final inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage increase my Holyoke home's value?",
      "answer": "Yes! Studies consistently show that solar + battery storage systems increase home values by 4-6% in Massachusetts. As Holyoke continues to grow and attract new residents, energy-independent homes with backup power are increasingly desirable. Your battery system also transfers to future owners with remaining warranty coverage, making it an excellent selling point."
