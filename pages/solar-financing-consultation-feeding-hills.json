 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available to Feeding Hills homeowners?",
   "answer": "Feeding Hills residents can access several substantial benefits: the federal Investment financing (deduct of installation cost from financing), Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production incentive payments), net metering trading opportunities, net metering benefits, and a 20-year increased property value. Together, these programs significantly reduce the effective cost of going solar. We'll calculate exactly how much you qualify for during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much can I save with solar in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "Savings depend on system size, energy usage, and financing method, but typical Feeding Hills homeowners save $24,000-$50,000 over 25 years after accounting for all benefits and reduced utility bills. With current programs, payback periods generally range from 7-11 years, after which you enjoy essentially free electricity for 15-20+ additional years. We'll provide exact savings projections customized to your Feeding Hills property during the consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I get solar with zero money down in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple lending partners offering $0-down solar loans for qualified Feeding Hills homeowners. Many clients find their monthly loan payment is actually lower than their previous electric bill, creating immediate positive cash flow and savings from day one. Interest rates typically range from 2.99%-6.99% depending on credit profile and loan term. We'll compare several zero-down options during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I buy or lease solar panels in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "For most Feeding Hills homeowners, purchasing solar (via cash or loan) delivers superior long-term financial value. When you own the system, you receive the full competitive pricing, all SMART program benefits, net metering income, and maximize lifetime savings - typically 25-35% more than leasing over 25 years. However, leasing can work for those who prefer predictable monthly costs with no maintenance responsibility. We'll model both scenarios with specific numbers for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the payback period for solar in Feeding Hills, Massachusetts?",
   "answer": "With current federal and Massachusetts benefits combined with Feeding Hills' utility rates, most homeowners achieve solar payback in 7-11 years. After payback, you enjoy free electricity for the remaining 15-20+ years of the system's warrantied life, dramatically multiplying your total savings. Factors affecting payback include system size, financing method, energy usage, roof condition and orientation, and financing options. Our detailed analysis will show your specific payback timeline."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does the Massachusetts SMART program benefit Feeding Hills homeowners?",
   "answer": "The SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target) program pays you a fixed incentive rate for every kilowatt-hour your solar system produces over 10-20 years. Payments are made monthly through your utility bill. A typical 7-8kW residential system in Feeding Hills can earn $330-$600 annually through SMART, in addition to electricity bill savings and the flexible financing. We handle the entire SMART enrollment process for you and provide exact payment projections during your consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will going solar increase my property taxes in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "No! Massachusetts law provides a 100% increased property value for 20 years. This means while solar typically increases your Feeding Hills home's value by 4-6%, your property taxes won't increase due to the solar addition. This is one of several Massachusetts benefits that make solar an excellent investment - your home value increases without raising your tax bill."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I get started with solar financing consultation in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "Getting started is easy! Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or submit a consultation request on our website. We'll schedule a convenient time for a free meeting at your Feeding Hills home, our office, or virtually. Bring 12 months of utility bills if available. Within 3-5 business days, you'll receive a comprehensive financial analysis showing your solar potential, all financing options, and multiple financing options with clear, transparent comparisons."
