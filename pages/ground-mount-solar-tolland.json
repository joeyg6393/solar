 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much land do I need for ground-mount solar in Tolland?",

  },
  {
   "question": "Can ground-mount solar handle Tolland winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are specifically engineered for Connecticut winters and Tolland County weather. They're designed to handle snow loads and wind typical in eastern Connecticut. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing easier than rooftop systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the typical cost for ground-mount solar in Tolland?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Tolland typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Connecticut benefits, net investment is substantially lower. Most Tolland homeowners achieve payback within 7-10 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are permits required for ground-mount solar in Tolland?",
   "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations require building permits and must comply with Tolland zoning regulations including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Tolland and county authorities, ensuring your system meets all codes and regulations."

   "question": "How long does installation take in Tolland?",
   "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Tolland typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."

  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance is required for ground-mount solar?",
