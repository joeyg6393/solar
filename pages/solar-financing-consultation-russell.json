    },
    {
      "question": "What types of solar financing are available in Russell?",
      "answer": "Russell homeowners can choose from multiple financing options: solar loans with 5-25 year terms and competitive rates starting at 2.99% APR, solar leases requiring no upfront investment with predictable fixed monthly payments, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) where you pay only for the electricity your system actually generates. Zero-down solar loans available for qualified applicants. During your free consultation, we analyze which option delivers the best financial outcome for your specific situation and goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can Russell homeowners save with solar energy?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on current electricity consumption, solar system size, and chosen financing method, but typical Russell homeowners reduce electric bills by 75-95%. Over a 25-year period, total cumulative savings usually range from $38,000 to $88,000. The competitive pricing plus MA SMART program immediately reduces installation costs by thousands of dollars upfront. We provide precise savings projections based on your actual Russell utility rates and historical usage patterns during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What credit score do I need for solar financing in Russell?",
      "answer": "While credit scores of 650 or above typically qualify for the most favorable solar loan rates and terms, we work with multiple financing partners serving diverse credit profiles and situations. Even with lower credit scores, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal or no credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we review your unique credit situation privately and identify the most appropriate financing solutions available to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get solar financing approved in Russell?",
      "answer": "The complete timeline from initial consultation to financing approval typically spans 1-3 weeks total. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours of your initial inquiry, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and most financing applications receive approval within 5-7 business days after proper submission. Once financing is approved, solar installation in Russell usually begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permit processing times and weather conditions."

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my solar system if I sell my Russell home?",
      "answer": "If you own your solar system through a loan, you have several options when selling your Russell property: pay off the remaining loan balance at closing using sale proceeds, transfer the loan obligation to the home buyer with lender approval, or include the loan payoff amount in your home's asking sale price. Research and studies consistently show that solar systems increase home values by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Russell property significantly more attractive and valuable to potential buyers. We thoroughly discuss these scenarios and options during your consultation."
