 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should I have my solar panels serviced in Springfield?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional solar panel maintenance at least once per year for Springfield homes. Given New England's seasonal weather variations, many customers benefit from bi-annual service—spring cleaning after winter storms and fall preparation before snow season. More frequent maintenance may be needed for systems near trees, in high-pollen areas, or commercial installations."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs that my solar panels need repair?",
   "answer": "Common warning signs include: sudden drops in energy production, inverter error messages or warning lights, physical damage to panels (cracks, discoloration), loose or corroded electrical connections, unusual noises from the inverter, and monitoring system alerts. If you notice any of these issues in your Springfield solar system, contact us for immediate diagnostics."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will cleaning my solar panels really improve performance?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Dirty solar panels can lose 15-25% of their efficiency. In Springfield, pollen, bird droppings, tree debris, and winter grime accumulate on panels, blocking sunlight and reducing energy production. Professional cleaning safely removes these contaminants and typically restores full performance, paying for itself through increased energy savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service all brands of solar panels and inverters?",
   "answer": "Yes, our NABCEP certified technicians are trained to service all major solar panel brands including SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, and more. We also work with all inverter types—string inverters, microinverters, and power optimizers from manufacturers like Enphase, SolarEdge, Fronius, and SMA. We maintain warranty compliance for all repairs."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance plan?",
   "answer": "Our Springfield annual maintenance plan includes: comprehensive 32-point system inspection, professional panel cleaning, inverter diagnostics and testing, electrical connection inspection and tightening, performance monitoring review, priority scheduling for service calls, 15% discount on any needed repairs, and detailed performance reports after each visit."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you repair solar panels damaged by storms?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide emergency storm damage repair services throughout Springfield and the Pioneer Valley. We assess hail damage, fallen tree limbs, high wind damage to mounting systems, and other weather-related issues. We work directly with insurance companies and provide detailed damage documentation to support your claims process."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does a typical solar maintenance visit take?",
   "answer": "A standard residential solar maintenance visit in Springfield typically takes 2-4 hours depending on system size and accessibility. This includes inspection, cleaning, testing, and documentation. More complex repairs may require additional time or follow-up visits. We always provide time estimates before beginning work."
