 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much land is required for ground-mount solar in Holland?",
   "answer": "A typical residential ground-mount system (8-12 kW) in Holland needs approximately 800-2,400 square feet of land. The exact requirement depends on your energy needs and desired capacity. Our Holland team conducts a comprehensive site assessment to determine the optimal layout for your property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can ground-mount solar handle Holland's winter weather?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are specifically engineered for Massachusetts winters and western MA weather patterns. They're designed to handle snow loads common in Holland and Hampden County. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing easier than rooftop systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the typical cost for ground-mount solar in Holland?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Holland typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Holland homeowners see payback within 7-10 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are permits required for ground-mount solar in Holland?",
   "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations require building permits and must comply with Holland zoning regulations including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Holland and Hampden County authorities, ensuring your system meets all codes and regulations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Holland?",
   "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Holland typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth in mind, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility makes ground-mount ideal for growing Holland families and agricultural businesses."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance is required for ground-mount solar?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual professional inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level accessibility makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Holland customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow."
