  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar in Westfield, MA after financing options?",
      "answer": "A typical residential solar system in Westfield costs $15,000-$35,000 before benefits. However, the competitive pricing immediately reduces this by $3,900-$9,100. Add Massachusetts SMART program payments of $20,000-$30,000 over 10 years, annual net metering income of $1,400-$2,400, and utility bill savings of $1,500-$2,500 per year, and your net solar investment becomes quite affordable. Many Westfield homeowners achieve full payback in 6-9 years, then enjoy 15-20 years of essentially free electricity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for solar in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Westfield residents have multiple solar financing choices: (1) Solar Loans - own your system with zero-down financing, qualify for all benefits, often with monthly payments lower than current electric bills; (2) Solar Leases - fixed monthly payments with no upfront costs, though the leasing company owns the system and receives benefits; (3) Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) - pay only for electricity produced at discounted rates; (4) Cash Purchase - pay upfront for fastest ROI and maximum lifetime savings. We'll help you compare all options based on your specific financial situation during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar in Westfield with no money down?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Zero-down solar financing is widely available in Westfield through solar loans, leases, and PPAs. Zero-down solar loans are particularly popular because you own the system immediately, qualify for the competitive pricing and all financing options, and often have monthly payments lower than your current electricity costs - creating positive cash flow from day one. We work with multiple lenders offering competitive rates specifically for Westfield solar customers. During your consultation, we'll show you exact monthly payment scenarios compared to your current utility bills."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does solar increase property costs in Westfield?",
      "answer": "No! Massachusetts law provides a 100% property assessment exemption for solar energy systems for 20 years from installation. This means that while solar panels increase your Westfield home's market value (typically 3-4% or $15,000-$25,000), you won't pay any additional property costs. This exemption is automatic throughout Westfield and all of Massachusetts, providing substantial long-term value beyond electricity bill savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Massachusetts SMART program?",
      "answer": "The SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target) program pays Westfield solar owners for every kilowatt-hour of electricity their system produces for 10 years. Payment rates typically range from $0.25-$0.35/kWh depending on system size and specific location. A standard 7kW residential system in Westfield produces approximately 8,000-8,500 kWh annually, earning $2,000-$2,975 per year in SMART benefits. Over the full 10-year program, that's $20,000-$29,750 in total payments that significantly reduce your net solar investment cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do net meterings work and what are they worth in Massachusetts?",
      "answer": "net metering (Solar Renewable Energy Certificates) represent proof that your solar system produced 1,000 kWh (1 megawatt-hour) of clean energy. You earn one net metering for every MWh produced, which you can sell on the Massachusetts net metering market. net metering prices fluctuate but have historically traded between $200-$300 in Massachusetts. A typical 7kW residential system in Westfield produces 7-8 net metering annually, generating $1,400-$2,400 in additional yearly income. This net metering revenue continues for 10-15 years, providing significant supplemental income that accelerates your solar payback period."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical payback period for solar in Westfield?",
      "answer": "The average payback period for solar in Westfield is 6-9 years, depending on system size, electricity usage, and financing method. This timeline accounts for the competitive pricing, ongoing SMART program payments, net metering income, and electricity bill savings. With rising utility rates, many Westfield homeowners achieve even faster payback. After the payback period, your solar panels continue producing free electricity for 15-20+ additional years, representing $30,000-$60,000 in total lifetime savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does net metering work for Westfield solar customers?",
      "answer": "Net metering allows your solar system to send excess electricity to the grid in exchange for credits on your utility bill. When your Westfield solar system produces more than you're using (typically sunny midday hours), the excess flows to the grid and you receive credits at the full retail electricity rate. These credits accumulate and offset electricity you purchase from the grid during nighttime or cloudy periods. With proper system sizing, many Westfield homeowners reduce their annual electricity costs to just the monthly connection fee, saving thousands per year."
