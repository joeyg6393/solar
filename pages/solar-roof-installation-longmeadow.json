  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the investment for solar roof in Longmeadow?",
      "answer": "Longmeadow solar roof installations typically range $45,000-$85,000 before benefits, varying with roof size, architectural complexity, and energy requirements. Massachusetts offers substantial benefits: the competitive pricing saves $12,000-$22,000, plus SMART program rebates. We offer premium financing options and will provide a detailed quote for your Longmeadow home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar roof installation take?",
      "answer": "Physical installation takes 5-10 days for most Longmeadow homes. The complete process from consultation to activation spans 8-12 weeks, including custom design, engineering, permitting with Longmeadow building department, installation, and Eversource interconnection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why choose Tesla Solar Roof over traditional panels?",
      "answer": "Tesla Solar Roof maintains Longmeadow's high architectural standards with seamless integration, eliminating visible panel mounting. It provides superior aesthetics, premium roofing protection, and maximizes home value. If your roof needs replacement, it combines both investments with better financial benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does solar roof perform well during New England winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs work effectively year-round in Longmeadow. While snow can temporarily reduce output, panels operate more efficiently in cold temperatures. Most roofs shed snow naturally. Net metering credits summer overproduction for winter consumption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties protect my investment?",
      "answer": "Your Longmeadow installation includes Tesla's 25-year performance warranty, comprehensive manufacturer warranties on all equipment, and our 10-year workmanship guarantee. Premium roofing materials are engineered for 50+ year lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I integrate battery storage with solar roof?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Tesla Powerwall battery integration is available and recommended for all Longmeadow installations. Battery storage provides nighttime solar usage, backup power during outages, and complete energy independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much energy will my Longmeadow solar roof produce?",
      "answer": "Production depends on roof size, orientation, and shading. Typical Longmeadow homes with south-facing solar roofs generate 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of household needs. We provide precise estimates during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need roof replacement before solar installation?",
      "answer": "No! Tesla Solar Roof includes complete replacement. If your Longmeadow roof needs replacement within 10-15 years, installing solar roof now maximizes available benefits while receiving both premium roofing and solar generation."
