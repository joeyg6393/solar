 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How does Longmeadow's tree coverage affect solar panel maintenance?",
   "answer": "Longmeadow's beautiful mature trees create unique maintenance considerations. Trees contribute to higher pollen and sap accumulation on panels, shed leaves and debris throughout fall, and may cause shading issues as they grow. We recommend annual maintenance minimum, with bi-annual service for heavily tree-shaded properties. Our maintenance includes assessment of tree growth impacts and recommendations for maintaining optimal solar production."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in a professional solar maintenance visit in Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "Our Longmeadow service includes: complete visual inspection of all system components, thermal imaging scan to detect defects and hot spots, inverter diagnostics and testing, electrical connection inspection and tightening, professional panel cleaning removing pollen and debris, mounting hardware verification, production monitoring analysis, shading assessment if relevant, safety testing, and detailed documentation with personalized recommendations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How often should Longmeadow solar panels be professionally cleaned?",
   "answer": "Most Longmeadow solar systems benefit from professional cleaning at least annually, typically in spring after pollen season or fall after leaf drop. Properties with heavy tree coverage or near especially high pollen sources may need cleaning twice yearly. Regular cleaning prevents efficiency losses of 15-30% caused by accumulated debris and ensures maximum energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service premium solar panel brands like SunPower?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our NABCEP certified technicians are extensively trained on all premium solar brands including SunPower, LG, Panasonic, and REC, as well as quality mainstream brands. We provide manufacturer-compliant service that protects your warranty while ensuring your premium Longmeadow solar investment receives the expert care it deserves. We maintain up-to-date certifications on all major brands."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you repair solar systems you didn't originally install?",
   "answer": "Yes, we service all solar installations in Longmeadow regardless of the original installer. Our team works with all major solar equipment brands and system configurations. We'll review your original documentation, honor existing warranties, and provide the same meticulous care we give systems we installed, ensuring your solar investment continues performing optimally."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the benefit of an annual maintenance plan for Longmeadow homes?",
   "answer": "Our Longmeadow annual plan provides: two comprehensive service visits strategically timed for local conditions, complete professional panel cleaning, detailed system inspections, inverter service, electrical testing, tree shading assessment, mounting verification, production optimization, priority emergency response, 15% discount on repairs, and detailed performance tracking. Regular maintenance extends system life, prevents failures, and maximizes your energy savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if my Longmeadow solar system is underperforming?",
   "answer": "Compare your current energy production to previous years' data for the same season. Drops of 15% or more often indicate maintenance needs—typically from dirty panels, equipment issues, or increased tree shading. Other warning signs include inverter error messages, monitoring system alerts, or higher electric bills. Contact us for complimentary diagnostics to definitively assess your system's performance and identify any issues."
