This includes the Level 2 charger unit ($400-$900), professional installation labor ($400-$800), and electrical work ($200-$800).

   "question": "Which EV charger is best for my Wilbraham home?",
   "answer": "The best charger depends on your EV model and charging needs. For Tesla owners, the Tesla Wall Connector offers seamless integration. For universal compatibility, ChargePoint Home Flex and JuiceBox work with all EVs and offer excellent smart features. Grizzl-E is ideal for outdoor Massachusetts installations. We'll recommend the perfect charger during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Does my Wilbraham home need electrical upgrades for EV charging?",
   "answer": "It depends on your home's electrical panel capacity. Level 2 EV chargers require a dedicated 40-50 amp, 240V circuit. Most Wilbraham homes built after 1990 have sufficient capacity. Older homes may need panel upgrades, which we handle completely including permits and Town of Wilbraham inspections. We provide free assessments."

Outdoor installations work perfectly in Wilbraham year-round. We ensure proper mounting, weatherproofing, and cable management for New England climate."

  },
  {
   "question": "How fast will my EV charge at home in Wilbraham?",
   "answer": "With a Level 2 charger in your Wilbraham home, you'll add 25-50 miles of range per hour - about 3-7x faster than a standard outlet. Most EVs fully charge overnight in 4-8 hours. A Tesla Model Y charges in about 7 hours, a Ford Mustang Mach-E in 8 hours, and a Chevy Bolt in 7 hours with Level 2 charging."
