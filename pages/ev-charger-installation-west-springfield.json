    },

      "question": "Can my West Springfield home support an EV charger?",
      "answer": "Most West Springfield homes can support Level 2 EV charging. Level 2 chargers require a dedicated 40-50 amp, 240V circuit. Homes built after 1990 typically have adequate panel capacity. Older homes may need panel upgrades. We provide free electrical assessments to determine exactly what your home needs."
    },
    {

      "question": "Should I install my charger indoors or outdoors in West Springfield?",

      "question": "Can I charge my EV with solar panels in West Springfield?",
