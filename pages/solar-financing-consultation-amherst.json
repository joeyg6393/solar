 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much is the federal solar financing worth for my Amherst home?",
   "answer": "The federal Investment financing (financing) allows you to deduct of your total solar installation cost through financing. For a typical Amherst solar system ranging from $20,000-$30,000, this translates to $5,200-$7,800 in financing savings. This applies to owned systems (cash or financed), not leased systems. We'll calculate your exact credit amount during the consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the Massachusetts SMART program and how does it benefit Amherst solar customers?",
   "answer": "The SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target) program provides fixed incentive payments for every kilowatt-hour your system produces over 10-20 years. Amherst residents can earn substantial ongoing income through this program. Payment rates vary based on system size and location, but typical residential systems earn $300-$800 annually. We'll show you exact SMART projections for your property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I afford solar with no money down in Amherst?",
   "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple lenders offering $0-down solar loans specifically designed for Massachusetts homeowners. Many Amherst clients find their monthly loan payment is lower than their previous electric bill, creating immediate positive cash flow. We'll compare multiple zero-down options with different terms and rates during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I buy, lease, or do a PPA for solar in Amherst?",
   "answer": "Each option has merits depending on your situation. Buying (cash or loan) gives you full ownership, all financings, and best long-term value - typically 20-30% more savings over 25 years. Leasing offers predictable monthly costs with no maintenance responsibility. PPAs let you pay only for the electricity produced. For most Amherst homeowners, we find purchasing with a solar loan provides optimal financial returns. We'll model all scenarios for your specific case."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long will it take to break even on solar in Amherst?",
   "answer": "With current benefits and Amherst's utility rates, most homeowners achieve payback in 7-11 years. After that, you enjoy essentially free electricity for another 15-20+ years. Factors affecting payback include system size, financing method, energy usage, and financing options. Our detailed financial analysis will show your specific payback timeline with conservative projections."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are there special solar programs for UMass employees or Amherst municipal customers?",
   "answer": "Yes! We're familiar with various programs that may apply to UMass community members and can help you access any available group purchasing programs or special financing arrangements. Additionally, if you're served by certain municipal utilities in the Amherst area, there may be specific net metering benefits or local benefits. We'll identify all applicable programs during your consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to solar financing if I move from my Amherst home?",
   "answer": "If you own your system (cash or loan), it typically increases your home's value - Massachusetts studies show solar homes sell for 4-6% more and sell faster. You can pay off any remaining loan balance from sale proceeds or transfer the loan to the buyer (with lender approval). Leases and PPAs can typically be transferred to new homeowners. We'll explain all scenarios and their implications."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I start the solar financing consultation process in Amherst?",
   "answer": "Simply call (413) 555-0100 or submit a consultation request on our website. We'll schedule a convenient time for a free meeting at your Amherst home, our office, or virtually. Bring 12 months of utility bills if possible. Within 3-5 business days, you'll receive a comprehensive analysis showing your solar potential, financing options, and multiple financing options with clear comparisons."
