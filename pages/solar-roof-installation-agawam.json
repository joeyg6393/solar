 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does solar roof installation cost in Agawam?",
   "answer": "Solar roof installations in Agawam typically range from $45,000-$85,000 before benefits, depending on roof size, complexity, and energy needs. However, Massachusetts offers exceptional benefits: the competitive pricing can save $12,000-$22,000, plus SMART program rebates. We offer $0 down financing and will provide a free customized quote for your Agawam property."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does the solar roof installation process take?",
   "answer": "Physical installation work takes 5-10 days for most Agawam homes, depending on roof size and weather. The complete process from initial consultation to final system activation typically spans 8-12 weeks, including design, permitting with Agawam building department, installation, and Eversource interconnection approval."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I choose Tesla Solar Roof or traditional solar panels?",
   "answer": "Tesla Solar Roof excels when you need roof replacement soon, prioritize aesthetics, or want to maximize home value. It combines premium roofing with solar generation in one integrated investment. Traditional panels cost less initially if your existing roof is in excellent condition. We'll help you decide during your free Agawam consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar roof work effectively during Agawam winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar roofs perform well year-round in Agawam. While snow can temporarily reduce output, solar panels actually operate more efficiently in cold temperatures. Most Agawam roofs have adequate pitch for natural snow shedding. Net metering credits summer overproduction for winter consumption."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties protect my Agawam solar roof investment?",
   "answer": "Your Agawam solar roof includes Tesla's industry-leading 25-year power production warranty, comprehensive manufacturer warranties on all equipment and materials, plus our 10-year workmanship guarantee covering installation quality. The premium roofing materials are engineered for a 50+ year lifespan."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add battery storage to my solar roof system?",
   "answer": "Yes! Tesla Powerwall battery integration is available and highly recommended for all Agawam solar roof installations. Battery storage enables nighttime solar usage, provides backup power during grid outages, and delivers complete energy independence. Many Agawam homeowners install 1-2 Powerwall units."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much energy will my Agawam solar roof generate?",
   "answer": "Energy production varies based on roof size, orientation, pitch, and shading. A typical Agawam home with an unshaded south-facing solar roof generates 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of average household electricity needs. We provide precise production estimates during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need to replace my roof before installing solar?",
   "answer": "No! Tesla Solar Roof installation includes complete roof replacement as an integral part of the system. If your Agawam home's roof needs replacement within the next 10-15 years, installing solar roof now makes exceptional financial sense while maximizing available financings and rebates."
