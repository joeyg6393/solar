  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How often should I schedule solar panel maintenance in Belchertown?",
      "answer": "We recommend professional maintenance at least annually for Belchertown solar systems. However, properties with heavy tree coverage or near agricultural areas may benefit from biannual service. Spring cleaning (April-May) removes winter residue and pollen, while fall service (September-October) prepares your system for winter. Regular maintenance can increase energy production by 15-30% compared to neglected systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are warning signs my solar panels need repair?",
      "answer": "Watch for these indicators: significant drop in energy production compared to previous months, error codes or warning lights on your inverter, visible damage to panels (cracks, burn marks), loose or corroded connections, water intrusion in junction boxes, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Belchertown solar system, contact us immediately for inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will cleaning my solar panels really improve performance?",
      "answer": "Yes! In Belchertown, environmental factors like pollen, dust, bird droppings, and tree sap can reduce solar panel efficiency by 20-30%. Professional cleaning removes these contaminants safely and effectively, often restoring near-original performance levels. The improved energy production quickly offsets the cleaning cost, especially for larger systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer emergency repair services in Belchertown?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We provide 24/7 emergency solar repair service for critical issues like complete system failure, electrical hazards, or storm damage. Our Belchertown-area emergency response typically arrives within 4 hours during business hours and 6-8 hours after hours. Most emergencies can be resolved on the first visit with our fully-stocked service vehicles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you maintain solar systems installed by other companies?",
      "answer": "Yes! We service all brands and types of solar installations throughout Belchertown, regardless of who performed the original installation. Our technicians are trained on all major solar equipment manufacturers and can provide warranty-compliant maintenance and repairs. We treat every system with the same professional care and attention to detail."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does your annual maintenance contract include?",
      "answer": "Our Belchertown annual maintenance contracts include: two comprehensive cleaning and inspection visits (spring and fall), priority scheduling for emergency repairs, 15% discount on all repair parts and labor, detailed performance reports after each visit, and firmware updates for your inverter. It's the most cost-effective way to protect your solar investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does solar panel repair cost in Belchertown?",
      "answer": "Repair costs vary by issue. Minor repairs like cleaning connections or resetting systems may be $150-250. Inverter repairs range from $500-1,500, while full inverter replacement costs $1,500-3,500. Individual panel replacement runs $300-600 per panel. We always provide detailed estimates before beginning work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will maintenance void my solar panel warranty?",
      "answer": "No - our professional maintenance services are warranty-compliant and actually help maintain your warranty coverage. Many solar warranties require proof of regular professional maintenance. We provide detailed service documentation that satisfies all manufacturer warranty requirements, protecting your investment and ensuring warranty claims are honored if needed."
