  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land do I need for a ground-mount solar system in Northampton?",
      "answer": "Typically, you need about 100-200 square feet per kilowatt of solar capacity. A standard residential system (8-10 kW) requires approximately 800-2000 square feet of clear, unshaded land. We can assess your Northampton property during our free consultation to determine the ideal system size and placement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount solar systems more expensive than rooftop systems?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems typically cost 10-15% more than rooftop installations due to additional racking and foundation requirements. However, they often produce 10-25% more energy due to optimal positioning, which can offset the higher initial cost. In Northampton, many property owners find ground-mount systems offer better long-term value, especially if roof replacement is needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special permits for ground-mount solar in Northampton?",
      "answer": "Yes, ground-mount solar installations in Northampton require building permits and electrical permits. Depending on your property's zoning and system size, you may also need planning board approval. We handle all permitting and ensure full compliance with Northampton's zoning bylaws and building codes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add more panels to my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes, one major advantage of ground-mount systems is expandability. We can design your initial installation with future expansion in mind, making it easy to add more panels as your energy needs grow or budget allows. This flexibility is especially valuable for Northampton farms and growing businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do ground-mount systems perform during Northampton winters?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems actually perform better in winter than rooftop systems because they can be tilted at steeper angles to shed snow quickly and capture low-angle winter sun. The easy ground-level access also makes snow clearing simple if needed. Our systems are engineered to withstand heavy New England snow loads."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a ground-mount solar system affect my property value in Northampton?",
      "answer": "Studies show that solar installations typically increase property values by 3-4%, and ground-mount systems don't impact your roof warranty or condition. In Northampton's environmentally-conscious market, properties with solar systems often attract premium buyers. The system can be transferred to new owners or included in the sale."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ground-mount solar be combined with agriculture or livestock?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Agrivoltaic systems are increasingly popular in Northampton and throughout the Pioneer Valley. We can design elevated ground-mount systems that allow sheep grazing, crop cultivation, or pollinator habitats underneath. This dual-use approach maximizes land value while producing clean energy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a ground-mount solar installation take in Northampton?",
      "answer": "The physical installation typically takes 2-4 days depending on system size. The total timeline from contract to activation is usually 4-8 weeks, including design, permitting with the City of Northampton, installation, and utility interconnection. We coordinate all steps to ensure a smooth process."
