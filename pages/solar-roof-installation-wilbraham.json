    {
      "question": "What is the investment for solar roof in Wilbraham?",
      "answer": "Wilbraham solar roof installations typically range $45,000-$85,000 before benefits, varying with roof size and complexity. Massachusetts offers exceptional benefits: the competitive pricing saves $12,000-$22,000, plus SMART program rebates. We offer premium financing options and will provide a detailed quote for your Wilbraham home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the installation process take?",
      "answer": "Physical installation takes 5-10 days for most Wilbraham homes. The complete process from consultation to activation spans 8-12 weeks, including custom design, permitting with Wilbraham building department, installation, and Eversource interconnection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why choose Tesla Solar Roof over traditional panels for my Wilbraham home?",
      "answer": "Tesla Solar Roof provides superior aesthetics with seamless integration, eliminating visible panel mounting. It offers premium roofing protection and maximizes home value. If your roof needs replacement, it combines both investments with better financial benefits than installing panels on an aging roof."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar roof perform well during Wilbraham winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Solar roofs work effectively year-round in Wilbraham. While snow can temporarily reduce output, panels operate more efficiently in cold temperatures. Most Wilbraham roofs have adequate pitch for natural snow shedding. Net metering credits summer overproduction for winter consumption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties protect my Wilbraham solar roof investment?",
      "answer": "Your Wilbraham installation includes Tesla's industry-leading 25-year power production warranty, comprehensive manufacturer warranties on all equipment and materials, plus our 10-year workmanship guarantee covering installation quality. Premium roofing materials are engineered for 50+ year lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I integrate battery storage with my solar roof?",
      "answer": "Yes! Tesla Powerwall battery integration is available and highly recommended for all Wilbraham installations. Battery storage enables nighttime solar usage, provides backup power during grid outages, and delivers complete energy independence. Many Wilbraham homeowners install 1-2 Powerwall units."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much energy will my Wilbraham solar roof generate?",
      "answer": "Energy production varies based on roof size, orientation, pitch, and shading. A typical Wilbraham home with an unshaded south-facing solar roof generates 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of average household electricity needs. We provide precise production estimates during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to replace my roof before installing solar?",
      "answer": "No! Tesla Solar Roof installation includes complete roof replacement as an integral part of the system. If your Wilbraham home's roof needs replacement within the next 10-15 years, installing solar roof now makes exceptional financial sense while maximizing available benefits and rebates."
