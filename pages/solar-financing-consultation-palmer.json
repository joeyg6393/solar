  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options are available to Palmer residents?",
      "answer": "Palmer homeowners can access several valuable benefits: the federal solar incentive (deduct of total installation cost from financing), Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production incentive payments), net metering trading opportunities, net metering benefits, and a 20-year increased property value. Together, these programs significantly reduce the effective cost of going solar. We'll calculate exactly how much you'll save during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money can I save with solar in Palmer?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on system size, energy usage, and financing method, but typical Palmer homeowners save $22,000-$50,000 over 25 years after accounting for all benefits and reduced utility bills. With current programs, payback periods generally range from 8-12 years, after which you enjoy essentially free electricity for 15-20+ additional years. We'll provide exact savings projections customized to your Palmer property during the consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar with no money down in Palmer?",
      "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple lending partners offering $0-down solar loans for qualified Palmer homeowners. Many clients find their monthly loan payment is actually lower than their previous electric bill, creating immediate positive cash flow and savings from day one. Interest rates typically range from 2.99%-6.99% depending on credit profile and loan term. We'll compare several zero-down options during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy or lease solar panels in Palmer?",
      "answer": "For most Palmer homeowners, purchasing solar (via cash or loan) delivers superior long-term financial value. When you own the system, you receive the full competitive pricing, all SMART program benefits, net metering income, and maximize lifetime savings - typically 25-35% more than leasing over 25 years. However, leasing can work for those who prefer predictable monthly costs with no maintenance responsibility. We'll model both scenarios with specific numbers for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the payback period for solar in Palmer, MA?",
      "answer": "With current federal and Massachusetts benefits combined with Palmer's utility rates, most homeowners achieve solar payback in 8-12 years. After payback, you enjoy free electricity for the remaining 15-20+ years of the system's warrantied life, dramatically multiplying your total savings. Factors affecting payback include system size, financing method, energy usage, roof condition, and financing options. Our analysis will show your specific payback timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Massachusetts SMART program benefit Palmer homeowners?",
      "answer": "The SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target) program pays you a fixed incentive rate for every kilowatt-hour your solar system produces over 10-20 years. Payments are made monthly through your utility bill. A typical 7-8kW residential system in Palmer can earn $300-$550 annually through SMART, in addition to electricity bill savings and the flexible financing. We handle the entire SMART enrollment process and show exact payment projections during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my solar financing if I move from Palmer?",
      "answer": "If you own your system (cash or financed), it typically increases your home's resale value significantly - Massachusetts studies show solar homes sell for 4-6% more and sell faster than comparable non-solar homes. You can pay off any remaining loan balance from sale proceeds or transfer the loan to the buyer with lender approval. Leases and PPAs can usually be transferred to new homeowners. We'll explain all scenarios during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I start the solar financing consultation process in Palmer?",
      "answer": "Getting started is easy! Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or submit a consultation request on our website. We'll schedule a convenient time for a free meeting at your Palmer home, our office, or virtually. Bring 12 months of utility bills if available. Within 3-5 business days, you'll receive a comprehensive financial analysis showing your solar potential, all financing options, and multiple financing options with clear, transparent comparisons."
