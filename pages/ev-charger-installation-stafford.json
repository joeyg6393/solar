 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does EV charger installation cost in Stafford, CT?",
   "answer": "EV charger installation in Stafford typically costs between $800-$2,500, which includes the charger unit, professional installation, electrical work, permit fees, and comprehensive testing. The final cost depends on factors like distance from your electrical panel, whether panel upgrades are needed, and which charger model you select. Most Stafford homeowners qualify for the flexible financing of 30% of costs up to $1,000, plus Connecticut financing options, significantly reducing the net investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Standard EV charger installations in Stafford take 3-5 hours to complete. If your electrical panel requires upgrading to support Level 2 charging, the project may take 6-8 hours or be scheduled across two visits. From initial consultation to driving away with a fully functional home charger, most Stafford customers are charging within 3-7 business days. We'll provide an accurate timeline after assessing your specific situation during the free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will I need to upgrade my electrical panel for an EV charger?",
   "answer": "It depends on your home's current electrical capacity. Many homes in Stafford have 100-amp or 150-amp electrical panels. Level 2 EV chargers typically require a dedicated 40-60 amp circuit. If your panel is near capacity or you have an older system, we may recommend upgrading to a 200-amp panel. This upgrade not only supports your EV charger but also future-proofs your home for other electrical needs like solar panels or heat pumps. Our electricians will assess this during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the best EV charger brand for Stafford's climate?",
   "answer": "All the major chargers we install—Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox, and Grizzl-E—are designed to handle Connecticut's climate extremes. For outdoor installations in Stafford, we particularly recommend the Grizzl-E for its exceptional cold-weather performance and durability, or the ChargePoint Home Flex which is NEMA 4 rated for harsh outdoor conditions. We'll recommend the best option based on your installation location, budget, and desired features."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I charge any electric vehicle with a Level 2 home charger?",
   "answer": "Yes! All electric vehicles sold in North America use the standard J1772 charging connector for Level 2 charging, making them universally compatible with home EV chargers. Tesla vehicles include a J1772 adapter, and Tesla Wall Connectors can charge non-Tesla vehicles with an adapter. Whether you drive a Tesla Model Y, Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Rivian R1T, or any other EV, your home charger will work perfectly."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you install outdoor EV chargers in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We install both indoor garage chargers and outdoor driveway/carport chargers throughout Stafford. Outdoor installations use weather-resistant chargers specifically designed to withstand Connecticut's climate, including heavy snow, ice, rain, and temperature swings from below zero to over 90 degrees. We'll help determine the ideal location based on where you park, electrical panel location, and convenience."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are needed for EV charger installation in Stafford?",
   "answer": "EV charger installations in Stafford require an electrical permit from the Town of Stafford Building Department to ensure all work meets Connecticut electrical code and safety standards. We handle all permit applications, submit necessary documentation, and coordinate required inspections on your behalf—you don't need to worry about the paperwork. Our installations always meet or exceed code requirements and pass inspection on the first visit. Permit fees are included in our quotes."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I power my EV with solar panels in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Yes, and it's an excellent investment! By installing solar panels on your Stafford home, you can charge your electric vehicle with clean, renewable energy at virtually no cost. We specialize in integrated solar and EV charging installations, designing complete systems that power both your home and vehicle. This combination maximizes flexible financings (30% for solar with no cap, plus up to $1,000 for EV charger), dramatically reduces your carbon footprint, and provides maximum long-term energy savings."
