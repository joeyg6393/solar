  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much can I save with solar panels in Northampton, MA?",
      "answer": "The average Northampton homeowner saves $1,200-$1,800 per year on electricity bills with solar panels. Over 25 years, this equals $30,000-$45,000 in total savings. Your actual savings depend on your current electricity usage, system size, and available roof space. With Massachusetts' net metering program, excess energy your system produces is credited at full retail rates, maximizing your savings. Schedule a free assessment to get an accurate savings estimate for your Northampton home."
    },
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options are available in Northampton and Massachusetts?",
      "answer": "Northampton homeowners qualify for excellent solar benefits: the flexible financing options on total system costs, Massachusetts SMART program payments for solar energy production, property assessment exemption for the added solar value, and net metering credits from utility companies. Combined, these benefits can reduce your solar installation costs by 40-50%. We help you navigate and maximize all financing options to ensure the best return on your investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar panel installation take in Northampton?",
      "answer": "The physical installation of solar panels on your Northampton home typically takes 1-3 days, depending on system size and roof complexity. The entire process from contract signing to system activation usually takes 6-10 weeks, which includes engineering design (1-2 weeks), permitting with the City of Northampton (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 days), and utility approval (2-3 weeks). We manage every step to ensure a smooth, timely installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar panels work during Northampton's winter months?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar panels work year-round in Northampton, even during winter. While snow and shorter days reduce production compared to summer, solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cold temperatures. Snow typically slides off tilted panels quickly, and any light snow is often blown clear by wind. Massachusetts receives excellent annual sun exposure, and our systems are designed to produce optimal energy across all four seasons. Net metering allows you to bank summer overproduction as credits for winter use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I need roof repairs or replacement after installing solar?",
      "answer": "We conduct thorough roof inspections before installation and only install on roofs with at least 15-20 years of life remaining. If your Northampton home needs roofing work, we can coordinate installation afterward. If roof repairs are needed after solar installation, we can temporarily remove and reinstall your panels. Our systems are designed for easy removal and reinstallation. We work with certified roofing contractors to ensure seamless coordination of any necessary roof work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels increase my Northampton home's value?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Studies show that homes with solar panels sell for 3-4% more than comparable homes without solar. For the median Northampton home value of around $400,000, that's an increase of $12,000-$16,000. Additionally, Massachusetts law exempts the added value of solar installations from property costs, so you gain the value without increased costs. Solar homes also sell faster, as buyers appreciate the lower energy costs and environmental benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance do solar panels require in Northampton?",
      "answer": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance in Northampton. Rain naturally cleans most panels, and the tilted angle helps debris slide off. We recommend an annual inspection and cleaning if needed, which we offer as part of our maintenance packages. Our monitoring systems alert us to any performance issues. With no moving parts, solar panels are extremely reliable. We provide a 10-year workmanship guarantee and can perform any necessary maintenance to keep your system producing optimal energy for decades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my Northampton solar system?",
      "answer": "Yes! We install battery storage systems like the Tesla Powerwall alongside your solar panels or as an addition to existing systems. Battery storage allows you to store excess solar energy for use during nighttime, power outages, or peak rate periods. This provides true energy independence and backup power for your Northampton home. While batteries add upfront costs, Massachusetts offers additional benefits for battery storage, and the benefits of backup power are invaluable during outages."
