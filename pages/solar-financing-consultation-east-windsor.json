    {
      "question": "What solar financing options can East Windsor, CT residents claim?",
      "answer": "East Windsor homeowners qualify for the flexible financing options which applies to the complete cost of your solar system including installation. Connecticut also provides the SMART program for solar renewable energy credits, net metering that credits your utility account for excess solar production, and various utility-specific rebates.

    },
    {
      "question": "What types of solar financing are available in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "East Windsor residents can choose from multiple financing options: solar loans with 5-25 year terms and competitive interest rates starting at 2.99% APR, solar leases requiring no upfront investment with predictable monthly payments, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) where you pay only for the electricity your system produces. Zero-down solar loans are available for qualified applicants. During your free consultation, we analyze which option delivers the best financial outcome for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money can East Windsor homeowners save with solar?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on your current electricity consumption, solar system size, and chosen financing method, but typical East Windsor homeowners reduce electric bills by 70-95%. Over a 25-year period, total savings usually range from $32,000 to $75,000. The competitive pricing immediately reduces your installation cost by thousands of dollars. We provide precise savings projections based on your actual East Windsor utility rates and consumption patterns during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What credit score do I need for solar financing in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "While credit scores of 650 or above typically qualify for the most favorable solar loan rates, we work with multiple financing partners who serve diverse credit profiles. Even with lower credit scores, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we'll review your credit situation and identify the most appropriate financing solutions available to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get solar financing approved in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "The complete timeline from initial consultation to financing approval typically spans 1-3 weeks. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours of your request, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and most financing applications receive approval within 5-7 business days after submission. Once approved, solar installation in East Windsor usually begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permit processing and weather conditions."

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my solar system if I sell my East Windsor home?",
      "answer": "If you own your solar system through a loan, you have several options when selling: pay off the remaining loan balance at closing using sale proceeds, transfer the loan to the buyer with lender approval, or include the loan payoff amount in your home's sale price. Studies consistently show that solar systems increase home values by more than the remaining loan balance, making your East Windsor property more attractive to potential buyers. We thoroughly discuss these scenarios during your consultation."
