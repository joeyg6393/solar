    {
      "question": "What's the total cost of solar roof in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Westfield solar roof installations typically cost $45,000-$85,000 before benefits. However, the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART program can reduce your investment by $15,000-$25,000+. We offer $0 down financing and will provide a free detailed quote for your Westfield property."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar roof installation take in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Physical installation takes 5-10 days for most Westfield homes. The complete process from consultation to activation spans 8-12 weeks, including design, Westfield building permits, installation, and Eversource interconnection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Tesla Solar Roof worth it compared to regular panels?",
      "answer": "Tesla Solar Roof provides superior aesthetics, integrated design, and premium roofing protection. If your Westfield roof needs replacement soon, solar roof combines both investments with better financial benefits. Traditional panels cost less if your roof is in good condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar roof work in Westfield winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs work year-round in Westfield. While snow temporarily reduces output, panels are more efficient in cold weather. Most Westfield roofs shed snow quickly. Net metering credits summer overproduction for winter use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties come with Westfield solar roof installation?",
      "answer": "Your Westfield solar roof includes Tesla's 25-year performance warranty, manufacturer warranties on all components, and our 10-year workmanship guarantee. The roofing materials last 50+ years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my solar roof?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Tesla Powerwall integration is available with all Westfield installations. Battery storage enables nighttime solar usage, backup power during outages, and complete energy independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much electricity will my Westfield solar roof produce?",
      "answer": "Production depends on roof size, orientation, and shading. Typical Westfield homes with south-facing solar roofs generate 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of household needs. We provide precise estimates during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to replace my roof first?",
      "answer": "No! Tesla Solar Roof includes complete roof replacement. If your Westfield roof needs replacement within 10-15 years, installing solar roof now maximizes available benefits while getting both a new roof and solar system."
