    {
      "question": "What does solar battery storage cost in East Windsor, CT?",
      "answer": "Solar battery storage installation in East Windsor typically costs $12,000-$25,000 depending on capacity and configuration. Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) installations average $14,000-$16,000 including equipment, labor, permits, and activation. After the competitive pricing, your actual investment drops to $10,360-$11,840.

    },
    {
      "question": "How long will a battery power my East Windsor home during an outage?",
      "answer": "Battery backup duration depends on your East Windsor home's consumption and battery size. A single Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits (fridge, lights, WiFi, outlets) for 24+ hours, or whole-home for 8-12 hours depending on usage. With solar panels, the battery recharges daily for indefinite backup. For complete whole-home backup, most East Windsor homes need 2-3 Powerwalls. We'll design the right system for your needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my existing East Windsor solar panels?",
      "answer": "Yes! We specialize in retrofitting battery storage to existing solar installations throughout East Windsor and Hartford County. Modern batteries like Tesla Powerwall integrate seamlessly with virtually all solar panel brands and inverter types, regardless of system age. We'll assess your current East Windsor solar setup and design the optimal battery integration to maximize your existing investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financial financing options are available for battery storage in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "East Windsor residents qualify for significant battery storage benefits. The Federal Solar Investment financing applies when batteries are paired with solar panels, saving $3,640+ on typical installations. Connecticut offers state-level benefits through Eversource's Energy Storage Solutions program. Combined benefits can reduce your total cost by 30-40%. We handle all incentive paperwork for your East Windsor installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which battery is best for East Windsor homes: Tesla Powerwall or alternatives?",
      "answer": "Tesla Powerwall is our most popular choice in East Windsor due to proven reliability, 13.5 kWh capacity, excellent warranty, and smart features. We also install LG Chem RESU (great value), Enphase IQ Battery (ideal for Enphase systems), and Generac PWRcell (highest capacity). The best battery for your East Windsor home depends on your solar equipment, energy usage, backup needs, and budget. We'll recommend the perfect solution during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage save money on my East Windsor electric bills?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! East Windsor residents served by Eversource can save significantly with battery storage. By using stored solar energy during expensive peak evening hours, you avoid high time-of-use rates. Typical East Windsor homeowners save $80-$150 monthly on electricity bills with optimized battery storage. Over the 10+ year battery life, total savings often reach $15,000-$30,000. We'll analyze your Eversource bills and calculate specific savings for your home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does battery installation take in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "Physical battery installation at your East Windsor home takes 1-2 days. The complete process from consultation to activated system typically takes 4-8 weeks, including system design, East Windsor building permits, Eversource utility approval, equipment procurement, installation, and final inspection. We manage every step and keep you updated throughout. Most East Windsor customers are impressed by how smooth the process is."
