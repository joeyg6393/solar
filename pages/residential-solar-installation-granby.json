  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much money can I save with solar panels in Granby?",
      "answer": "The average Granby homeowner saves $1,300-$1,900 per year on electricity with solar panels, accumulating to $32,500-$47,500 in total savings over 25 years. Your exact savings depend on current electricity consumption, system size, roof characteristics, and financing options. With Massachusetts' excellent net metering program, you receive full retail rate credits for excess energy production, maximizing returns. Many Granby homeowners reduce electric bills by 75-95% or achieve near-zero bills year-round. We provide detailed savings projections during your free assessment based on your actual energy usage and utility rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options can Granby homeowners access?",
      "answer": "Granby residents benefit from outstanding solar benefits: flexible financing options applied to total system costs, Massachusetts SMART program providing 10 years of monthly incentive payments based on production, professional installation purchases, property assessment exemption on solar-added home value, and net metering with full retail rate credits for excess production. These combined benefits can reduce your effective solars by 45-55%. Our team helps you maximize every available incentive to ensure the best possible return on your solar investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar installation take for a Granby home?",
      "answer": "Physical installation of solar panels on your Granby home typically takes 1-3 days depending on system size and roof complexity. The complete process from contract to activation averages 8-12 weeks: custom design and engineering (1-2 weeks), permitting with Granby building department and utility (3-5 weeks), professional installation (1-3 days), utility net metering approval (2-4 weeks), and final inspection and activation (1 week). We manage every step efficiently while keeping you informed throughout. Many Granby homeowners are surprised by how smooth and streamlined the process is."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar panels produce enough energy during Granby winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar panels work effectively year-round in Granby. While winter has shorter days and occasional snow coverage, Massachusetts receives strong annual sunlight that makes solar highly productive. Solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cold temperatures. The panels' dark surface and tilted mounting angle cause snow to melt and slide off quickly. Our systems are engineered specifically for Massachusetts weather and seasonal variations. Additionally, net metering allows you to bank excess summer production as credits for winter use, ensuring consistent savings throughout the year regardless of seasonal production variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my roof needs replacement before installing solar?",
      "answer": "We conduct thorough roof inspections during assessments and only install on roofs with 15-20+ years of remaining life. If your Granby home needs roofing work, we recommend completing it before solar installation - this timing is actually ideal since solar panels will protect your new roof for decades. We can coordinate with trusted Granby roofing contractors to streamline the process. If unexpected roof work is needed after installation, our solar systems are designed for temporary removal and professional reinstallation. Proper roof condition before solar ensures decades of trouble-free system operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do solar panels affect my Granby home's property value?",
      "answer": "Solar panels significantly increase property value! Research shows solar installations increase home values by 3-4% on average. For Granby homes, this typically translates to $10,000-$16,000 in added value. Massachusetts law provides a property assessment exemption on solar-added value, so you gain the increased value without higher property costs. Solar homes also sell approximately 20% faster than comparable non-solar homes, as buyers value lower energy costs and environmental benefits. Your solar investment enhances both your current lifestyle and future resale value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance do solar panels require in Granby?",
      "answer": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance in Granby. Natural rainfall cleans panels effectively, and the tilted mounting angle allows dirt and debris to wash away. We recommend annual visual inspections and professional cleaning if needed, available through our optional maintenance packages. Our advanced monitoring systems immediately alert you to any performance issues. With no moving parts, solar panels are extremely durable and reliable. We provide comprehensive 10-year workmanship guarantees and stand behind every installation. Most Granby homeowners enjoy decades of maintenance-free solar production with only occasional monitoring checks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery backup to my Granby solar system?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We install battery storage systems like Tesla Powerwall, LG Chem, and Enphase batteries either during initial installation or as retrofits to existing systems. Battery storage captures excess solar production for use during nighttime, cloudy periods, or power outages, providing energy independence and backup power for your Granby home. While batteries increase upfront investment ($10,000-$16,000), Massachusetts offers specific battery storage benefits, and the security of backup power during storms is invaluable. We design systems ranging from essential circuit backup to whole-home solutions based on your needs and budget."
