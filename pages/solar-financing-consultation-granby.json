 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much is the federal solar financing worth in Granby?",
   "answer": "The federal Investment financing (financing) allows you to deduct of your total solar installation cost through financing. For a typical Granby solar system ranging from $18,000-$28,000, this translates to $4,680-$7,280 in direct financing savings. This substantial credit applies to owned systems (cash or financed), though not to leased systems. We'll calculate your exact credit during the free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the Massachusetts SMART program and how does it benefit Granby homeowners?",
   "answer": "The SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target) program provides fixed incentive payments for every kilowatt-hour your solar system produces over 10-20 years. Granby residents receive monthly payments through their utility bill based on production. A typical 7-8kW residential system can earn $350-$650 annually through SMART. This is in addition to utility bill savings and the flexible financing. We'll show exact SMART projections for your property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I get solar with zero money down in Granby?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We work with multiple lending partners offering $0-down solar loans specifically for Massachusetts homeowners. Many Granby clients discover their monthly loan payment is actually lower than their previous electric bill, creating immediate positive cash flow and savings from day one. Interest rates typically range from 2.99%-6.99% depending on credit profile and loan term. We'll compare multiple zero-down options during your consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I buy or lease solar panels in Granby?",
   "answer": "For most Granby homeowners, purchasing solar (via cash or loan) provides the best long-term financial value. When you own the system, you receive the full competitive pricing, all SMART program benefits, and maximize lifetime savings - typically 25-35% more than leasing over 25 years. However, leasing can work for those who prefer predictable monthly costs with zero maintenance responsibility. We'll model both scenarios with specific numbers for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the payback period for solar in Granby?",
   "answer": "With current federal and Massachusetts benefits combined with Granby's utility rates, most homeowners achieve solar payback in 7-11 years. After payback, you enjoy essentially free electricity for the remaining 15-20+ years of the system's warrantied life. Factors affecting payback include system size, financing method, energy usage, and financing options. Our detailed analysis will show your specific payback timeline."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels increase my Granby home value?",
   "answer": "Yes! Studies consistently show that solar panels increase home values in Massachusetts by 4-6% on average. Additionally, solar homes tend to sell faster than comparable non-solar homes. Massachusetts law also provides a 20-year increased property value, so while your home's value increases, your Granby property taxes won't go up due to the solar addition. This is a great long-term investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar financing if I sell my Granby home?",
   "answer": "If you own your system (cash or financed), it typically adds significant value to your home sale. You can pay off any remaining loan balance from sale proceeds or, with lender approval, transfer the loan to the buyer. Many buyers appreciate assuming a solar loan with payments lower than typical electric bills. Leases and PPAs can usually be transferred to new homeowners. We'll explain all scenarios during your consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I start the solar financing consultation process in Granby?",
   "answer": "Getting started is easy! Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or submit a consultation request on our website. We'll schedule a convenient time for a free meeting at your Granby home, our office, or virtually. Bring 12 months of utility bills if available.
