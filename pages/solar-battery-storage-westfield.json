  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar battery storage cost in Westfield?",
      "answer": "A Tesla Powerwall installation in Westfield typically costs $12,500-$16,500 before benefits. After applying the competitive pricing and Massachusetts rebates, your net investment is approximately $9,200-$12,200. Most Westfield residents install 1-2 Powerwalls based on their backup needs and home size. We provide free detailed quotes and financing options including $0 down plans."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will a battery power my Westfield home?",
      "answer": "One Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits in a typical Westfield home for 24-36 hours during an outage, including lights, refrigerator, internet, heating controls, and select outlets. For whole-home backup including HVAC, water heater, and all appliances, most Westfield homes require 2-3 Powerwalls. We'll assess your specific needs during our free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can battery storage handle Westfield's cold winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Tesla Powerwall and other premium battery systems are engineered to operate reliably in Massachusetts winter conditions, functioning efficiently from -4°F to 122°F. We typically install batteries in garages or on exterior walls with proper weather protection. Westfield homeowners have successfully used battery backup through severe winter storms without any performance issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add batteries to my existing Westfield solar system?",
      "answer": "Yes! Battery storage can be retrofitted to almost any existing solar panel system in Westfield. Whether your solar installation is brand new or 10+ years old, we can integrate battery storage seamlessly. The retrofit process involves installing the battery unit, potentially upgrading your inverter, and updating electrical connections. Most Westfield retrofit projects are completed in 1-2 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for battery storage in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Westfield homeowners qualify for the flexible financing options on battery storage when paired with solar panels. You can also participate in Massachusetts' ConnectedSolutions program, earning $225-$375 annually per Powerwall for providing grid support. Combined with energy savings through time-of-use optimization, battery storage delivers excellent financial returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Westfield?",
      "answer": "The physical installation of solar battery storage in Westfield takes 1-2 days for most residential projects. The complete process from initial consultation to system activation typically spans 3-4 weeks, including custom system design, permitting with the City of Westfield, Eversource interconnection approval, professional installation, and final inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tesla Powerwall vs Enphase IQ Battery - which is better for Westfield?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent choices! Tesla Powerwall offers 13.5 kWh per unit in a sleek all-in-one design - ideal for most Westfield homes. Enphase IQ Battery provides modular flexibility (start with 3.3 kWh, expand as needed) and integrates perfectly with Enphase microinverters. We'll recommend the best option based on your existing solar setup, backup requirements, and budget during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage increase my Westfield home's value?",
      "answer": "Yes! Research shows that solar + battery storage systems increase home values by 4-6% in Massachusetts. Westfield homebuyers increasingly prioritize energy independence and backup power capability, especially after experiencing storm-related outages. Your battery system transfers to future owners with remaining warranty coverage, making it a valuable selling feature."
