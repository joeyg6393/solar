    },
    {
      "question": "What are net meterings worth in Massachusetts?",
      "answer": "net metering represent 1,000 kWh of solar production, sellable at historically $200-$300. A 7kW system in Longmeadow produces 7-8 net metering annually, generating $1,400-$2,400 in additional yearly income for 10-15 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does net metering work in Longmeadow?",
      "answer": "Net metering credits you at full retail rates for excess solar electricity sent to the grid. Credits accumulate and offset electricity purchased during nighttime or cloudy periods. Many Longmeadow homeowners reduce annual costs to just the monthly connection fee."
