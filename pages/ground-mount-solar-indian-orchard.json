 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "A typical residential ground-mount system (6-12 kW) in Indian Orchard requires 600-2,400 square feet of land. The exact footprint depends on your energy needs and system capacity. Our Indian Orchard team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is ground-mount solar suitable for urban neighborhoods like Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "Yes! While Indian Orchard is part of Springfield, many properties have sufficient yard space for ground-mount systems. Ground-mount solar is perfect for properties with roof shading from nearby buildings or trees, or homes with aging roofs. We'll assess your property to determine if ground-mount is the right solution."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the cost for ground-mount solar in Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Indian Orchard typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Indian Orchard homeowners see payback within 7-10 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations in Indian Orchard require building permits from the City of Springfield and must comply with local zoning including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with Springfield authorities, ensuring your system meets all Massachusetts codes and regulations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Indian Orchard typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and inspections (1-2 weeks)."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility is much greater than rooftop systems, ideal for growing Indian Orchard families."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Indian Orchard customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow."
