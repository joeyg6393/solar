 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available for Windsor Locks residents in 2024?",
   "answer": "Windsor Locks residents can take advantage of the flexible financing options, which applies to the total cost of your solar system. Additionally, Connecticut offers the SMART program for solar renewable energy credits, net metering credits that reduce your utility bills, and potential local utility rebates. Our consultants help you navigate all financing options to maximize your savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for solar in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "We offer multiple financing paths for Windsor Locks homeowners: solar loans (with terms from 5-25 years and competitive APRs), solar leases (no upfront cost, fixed monthly payments), and power purchase agreements (PPAs where you pay only for the electricity produced). We also have zero-down financing options. During consultation, we'll analyze which option provides the best financial outcome for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much can I save with solar in Windsor Locks, CT?",
   "answer": "Savings vary based on your current electricity usage, system size, and financing method, but most Windsor Locks homeowners save 50-90% on their monthly electricity bills. Over 25 years, total savings typically range from $25,000 to $60,000. The competitive pricing immediately reduces your system cost by thousands. We provide detailed savings projections during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need good credit to finance solar panels in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "While good credit (typically 650+) helps secure the best financing rates, we work with multiple lenders who offer programs for various credit profiles. Even with less-than-perfect credit, options like solar leases and PPAs may be available. During consultation, we'll review your credit situation and identify the best financing solutions available to you."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does the solar financing process take in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "From initial consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks. We schedule your free consultation within 24-48 hours, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and financing approval usually comes within 5-7 business days after application. Once approved, installation can begin within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting and scheduling."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is solar financing consultation really free with no obligation?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our Windsor Locks solar financing consultation is completely free with zero obligation to move forward. We provide comprehensive energy audits, financial projections, and incentive research at no cost. We believe in empowering homeowners with information to make confident decisions. There's no pressure to proceed unless the numbers make sense for you."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Windsor Locks home?",
   "answer": "If you own your solar system through a loan, you have several options when selling: pay off the remaining loan balance at closing, transfer the loan to the buyer (with lender approval), or factor the loan payoff into your sale price. Solar systems typically increase home value by more than the remaining loan balance. We discuss these scenarios during consultation to help you plan ahead."
