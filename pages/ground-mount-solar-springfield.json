  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land do I need for a ground-mount solar system in Springfield?",
      "answer": "For residential systems in Springfield, you typically need 300-400 square feet of unshaded land per kilowatt of solar capacity. A standard 10kW system requires approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet (roughly the size of a large backyard). Our team will assess your Springfield property during the free site consultation to determine the optimal system size and placement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount solar systems more expensive than rooftop installations?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems in Springfield typically cost 10-15% more than rooftop installations due to additional racking, trenching, and foundation work. However, they often produce 10-25% more energy due to optimal positioning and better cooling. Many Springfield homeowners find the increased production and easier maintenance justify the additional upfront cost, especially with available financing options."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required for ground-mount solar in Springfield, MA?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar installations in Springfield require building permits from the City of Springfield Building Department and electrical permits. Some properties may need zoning approval depending on system size and setback requirements. We handle all permitting and ensure compliance with Springfield's local regulations as part of our comprehensive installation service."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a ground-mount solar installation take in Springfield?",
      "answer": "After permits are approved, most residential ground-mount installations in Springfield take 3-5 days to complete. The permitting process typically takes 4-8 weeks. Commercial installations may take longer depending on system size. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your free consultation and keep you informed throughout the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount solar system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! One major advantage of ground-mount systems is their expandability. We can design your Springfield installation with future expansion in mind, making it easy to add more panels as your energy needs grow or budget allows. This flexibility makes ground-mount systems ideal for Springfield property owners planning long-term."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will ground-mount solar panels affect my lawn or landscaping?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems have a minimal impact on Springfield properties. Panels are typically elevated 3-4 feet above ground, allowing grass or low vegetation to grow underneath. We restore landscaping after installation and can work around existing features. Many Springfield homeowners even use the shaded area beneath panels for shade-loving plants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for ground-mount solar in Springfield, MA?",
      "answer": "Springfield residents qualify for the competitive pricing, Massachusetts SMART program benefits (10-20 years of production payments), and potential property assessment exemptions. These benefits can reduce your total system cost by 40-60%. We help you navigate all available programs to maximize your savings."
