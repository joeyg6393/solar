 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much can my Westfield business save with commercial solar?",
   "answer": "Westfield businesses typically reduce electricity costs by 60-80% with commercial solar. Actual savings depend on your current energy usage, system size, and rates from Westfield Gas & Electric. We've helped Westfield companies save $25,000-$150,000+ over 25 years. During your free consultation, we analyze your utility bills to provide precise savings projections."
  },
  {
   "question": "Does Westfield Gas & Electric offer any solar financing options?",
   "answer": "While Westfield Gas & Electric is a municipal utility, your business still qualifies for the Federal Investment financing, Massachusetts SMART program benefits, and MACRS accelerated depreciation. These combined benefits reduce your net investment by 40-50%. We work directly with WG&E for smooth interconnection."
  },
  {
   "question": "What size solar system does my Westfield business need?",
   "answer": "System size depends on your energy consumption, available roof or land space, and budget. Small Westfield retail businesses might install 15-40kW systems, while larger facilities often need 75-300kW or more. We analyze your utility bills and property to recommend the optimal size that maximizes ROI while meeting your goals."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I go solar with zero upfront cost in Westfield?",
   "answer": "Yes! We offer solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and lease programs requiring $0 down. You start saving immediately on electricity while we own and maintain the system. This is ideal for Westfield businesses wanting savings without capital expenditure. We also offer traditional loans and cash purchases for maximum tax benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does commercial solar installation take in Westfield?",
   "answer": "Physical installation typically takes 1-3 days depending on system size. The complete process from contract to activation usually takes 2-4 months, including design, City of Westfield permits, WG&E utility approvals, installation, and inspections. We coordinate everything to minimize disruption to your business operations."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels work well in Westfield's climate?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels perform efficiently in Westfield's climate and actually work better in cooler temperatures. While we get snow in winter, our systems are engineered for Massachusetts weather conditions. Annual production estimates account for seasonal variations, and most Westfield businesses meet or exceed projected energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance do commercial solar systems require?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar systems require minimal maintenance. Our monitoring systems provide alerts for any performance issues. We recommend annual inspections and occasional cleaning for optimal output. All Westfield installations include a 10-year workmanship warranty, and optional maintenance plans are available for complete peace of mind."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does commercial solar impact my Westfield property value?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar typically increases property values by 15-20%. Properties with solar are more attractive to buyers and tenants due to lower operating costs. In Westfield's competitive commercial real estate market, solar-equipped buildings command premium prices while demonstrating forward-thinking ownership."
