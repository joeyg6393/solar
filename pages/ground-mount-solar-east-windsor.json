 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space do I need for ground-mount solar in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "Most residential ground-mount systems in East Windsor (6-12 kW) require 600-2,400 square feet of land. The exact footprint depends on your energy consumption and desired system capacity. Our team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your East Windsor property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is ground-mount solar more expensive than rooftop?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount systems typically cost 10-20% more upfront due to additional racking and foundation work. However, they often produce 15-25% more energy due to optimal positioning, resulting in better long-term value. The competitive pricing applies equally to ground-mount systems, and the superior performance often justifies the investment for East Windsor property owners."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can ground-mount solar handle East Windsor weather?",
   "answer": "Yes! Our ground-mount systems are engineered specifically for Connecticut weather conditions. They're designed to handle snow loads, wind, and temperature variations typical in East Windsor. The angled design naturally sheds snow, and ground-level access makes any needed clearing much easier than rooftop systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in East Windsor typically takes 8-12 weeks from contract to activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and inspections (1-2 weeks). We keep you informed throughout the entire process."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are required in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar in East Windsor requires building permits and must comply with local zoning including setback requirements. Our team is thoroughly familiar with East Windsor regulations and handles all permitting on your behalf, ensuring your system meets all Hartford County and town requirements."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my system later?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! One major advantage of ground-mount solar is expandability. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility makes ground-mount ideal for growing families and businesses in East Windsor."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance is required?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning. The ground-level accessibility makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most East Windsor customers find that rain naturally keeps panels clean, with occasional leaf or snow clearing as needed."
