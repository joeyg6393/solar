    {
      "question": "What does solar roof installation cost in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "West Springfield solar roof installations range $45,000-$85,000 before benefits. The competitive pricing and SMART program can reduce this by $15,000-$25,000+. We offer $0 down financing and free customized quotes for your West Springfield home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take?",
      "answer": "Physical installation takes 5-10 days for most West Springfield homes. The complete process from consultation to activation takes 8-12 weeks, including design, permitting, installation, and utility approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "Solar Roof vs traditional solar panels - which is better?",
      "answer": "Solar Roof offers superior aesthetics and integrated design. If your roof needs replacement, it combines both investments with better financial benefits. Traditional panels cost less upfront if your roof is in excellent condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does solar roof work during West Springfield winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs work year-round. While snow can temporarily reduce output, panels are more efficient in cold weather. Most roofs shed snow quickly, and net metering credits summer production for winter use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties are included?",
      "answer": "Your West Springfield installation includes Tesla's 25-year performance warranty, manufacturer warranties on all equipment, and our 10-year workmanship guarantee. Roofing materials last 50+ years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage?",
      "answer": "Yes! Tesla Powerwall integration is available with all installations. Batteries provide nighttime solar usage, backup power during outages, and complete energy independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much energy will my solar roof produce?",
      "answer": "Production varies by roof size, orientation, and shading. Typical West Springfield homes generate 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of electricity needs. We provide precise estimates during consultations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need roof replacement first?",
      "answer": "No! Solar Roof includes complete replacement. If your roof needs replacement within 10-15 years, installing solar roof now maximizes benefits while getting both a new roof and solar system."
