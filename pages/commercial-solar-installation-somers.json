  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What are the energy savings for Somers commercial solar installations?",
      "answer": "Somers businesses typically see 65-70% reduction in electricity costs after solar installation. Depending on your facility size and energy usage, annual savings range from $10,000 to $50,000+. A properly sized 100kW system in Somers can save approximately $20,000-$30,000 per year."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I determine the right system size for my Somers business?",
      "answer": "We analyze your past 12-24 months of utility bills to understand your consumption patterns, then evaluate your facility to determine optimal system capacity. Factors include available roof/ground space, budget, and your energy goals. We design systems ranging from 20kW to 500kW+ based on these variables."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the installation timeline for commercial solar in Somers?",
      "answer": "Typical Somers commercial projects take 6-12 weeks from contract to system activation. This includes design and engineering (1-2 weeks), permitting with Somers and state authorities (2-4 weeks), installation (1-4 weeks depending on size), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar installation disrupt my business operations?",
      "answer": "Our installation process is designed to minimize disruption. Most rooftop work doesn't impact daily operations. Electrical connections require brief power interruptions (typically 2-4 hours) which we schedule during off-peak times or weekends based on your preference."
    },
    {
      "question": "How well do solar panels perform during Connecticut winters?",
      "answer": "Solar panels are highly effective in Connecticut's climate. They actually operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures. While snow may temporarily reduce production, it typically melts quickly, and annual energy production meets our projections. Panels are engineered for New England weather conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for Somers businesses?",
      "answer": "We partner with leading commercial solar financing companies offering various options including term loans, operating leases, capital leases, and PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements). Many Somers businesses prefer ownership to capture full financial benefits. We'll help you identify the best financing structure for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my solar system needs repairs?",
      "answer": "Our systems include comprehensive warranties covering panels (25 years), inverters (12-25 years), and workmanship (10 years). We offer maintenance agreements for Somers businesses including monitoring, inspections, and priority service. Most commercial systems require minimal maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my solar system in the future?",
      "answer": "Yes, we can design systems with future expansion in mind. If you anticipate business growth or increased energy needs, we'll ensure your electrical infrastructure and roof/ground space can accommodate additional panels later. Many Somers businesses start with partial offset and expand over time."
