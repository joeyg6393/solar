Whether you're concerned about power outages during storms or want to eliminate expensive peak-hour electricity charges, we design customized battery storage solutions for your Stafford home.\n\nSolar battery storage revolutionizes home energy management in Stafford.

    {
      "question": "How much does Tesla Powerwall installation cost in Stafford, CT?",
      "answer": "Tesla Powerwall installation in Stafford costs approximately $14,000-$16,000 for a single 13.5 kWh unit, including all equipment, professional installation, permits, and system activation. After applying the competitive pricing, your net investment drops to $10,360-$11,840. Multiple Powerwalls cost less per unit when installed together.

For complete whole-home backup, most Stafford homes require 2-3 Powerwalls depending on home size and energy consumption. With solar panels, batteries recharge daily for indefinite backup capability. We'll design a system that provides the exact backup coverage your Stafford family needs."

      "answer": "Absolutely! We specialize in retrofitting battery storage to existing solar installations throughout Stafford and Tolland County.

We'll assess your current Stafford solar installation and design the optimal battery integration to maximize your existing solar investment."

    },
    {
      "question": "How long do solar batteries last in Connecticut's climate?",
      "answer": "Premium batteries like Tesla Powerwall are engineered for 10+ years of daily cycling and come with 10-year warranties.

    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage save money on my Stafford electricity bills?",

Typical Stafford homeowners save $80-$150 monthly on electricity bills with optimized battery storage. Over the system's 10+ year lifetime, total savings typically reach $15,000-$30,000. We'll analyze your Eversource bills and calculate specific projected savings for your Stafford home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the battery installation process take in Stafford?",
