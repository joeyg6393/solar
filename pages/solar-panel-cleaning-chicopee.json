  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How often do solar panels need cleaning in Chicopee, MA?",
      "answer": "We recommend professional cleaning 2-3 times annually for Chicopee solar systems. Ideal timing is spring (post-pollen), mid-summer (after dust accumulation), and fall (before winter). Properties near Chicopee's industrial areas or along the Connecticut River may need quarterly cleaning due to increased particulate exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Chicopee solar panels get so dirty?",
      "answer": "Chicopee's unique location creates several challenges: river humidity attracts airborne particles, seasonal pollen from surrounding forests, industrial emissions from manufacturing facilities, bird activity near the Connecticut River, and road dust from Routes 391 and 90. Combined, these factors can reduce efficiency by 20-30% without regular cleaning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is professional cleaning worth the cost in Chicopee?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! The average Chicopee solar system loses $200-$500 annually in energy production from dirty panels. Professional cleaning costs $150-$280 but typically restores 20-25% efficiency, providing immediate ROI plus extended panel lifespan worth thousands over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can't I just spray my panels with a hose?",
      "answer": "Hosing removes loose debris but leaves mineral deposits from Chicopee's hard water, creating hazy films that reduce efficiency. Worse, pressure washing can crack panels or force water into electrical components. Our purified water system eliminates minerals while our soft-bristle method safely removes stubborn buildup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work on all types of solar panels in Chicopee?",
      "answer": "Yes! We clean all major solar panel brands and types including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, thin-film, and solar shingle installations. Our technicians are trained in manufacturer-specific requirements for brands popular in Chicopee like LG, SunPower, Canadian Solar, and Tesla."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if it rains right after you clean my panels?",
      "answer": "Our purified water cleaning creates a hydrophobic effect that actually helps rain sheet off cleanly without leaving spots. Unlike tap water residue, our process leaves no minerals for rain to interact with. If heavy storms deposit unusual debris within 48 hours of cleaning, we'll return for touch-ups at no charge."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my Chicopee solar panels need cleaning?",
      "answer": "Check your monitoring app for declining production compared to previous months. Visible signs include bird droppings, pollen accumulation, or visible dirt/dust layers. If you haven't cleaned panels in 6+ months in Chicopee, they likely need attention. We offer free assessments to evaluate your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer discounts for multiple Chicopee homes?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer neighborhood group rates when multiple Chicopee homeowners schedule together. We also provide discounts for referrals, veterans, seniors, and customers who sign up for our annual maintenance plans. Contact us to learn about current Chicopee-area promotions."
