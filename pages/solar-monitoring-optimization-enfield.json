  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does solar monitoring work in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Solar monitoring uses hardware sensors connected to your solar panels, inverters, and batteries to collect real-time performance data. This data is transmitted to cloud-based platforms accessible via mobile apps and web dashboards. You can see exactly how much energy your system produces at any moment, track historical performance, compare against expected output for Enfield's weather conditions, and receive instant alerts when issues arise."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when monitoring detects a problem?",
      "answer": "When our monitoring platform detects underperformance, equipment failures, or abnormal operation, you receive instant alerts via your preferred method (email, text, app notification). The alert includes details about the issue detected. You can then contact our team for immediate evaluation. Our technicians can often diagnose problems remotely and schedule service calls to restore optimal performance quickly, minimizing lost energy production."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is monitoring compatible with my existing Enfield solar system?",
      "answer": "Yes, in almost all cases. Our monitoring solutions work with all major solar equipment manufacturers including Enphase, SolarEdge, Tesla, Fronius, SMA, Generac, LG, and more. If your system was installed without monitoring capabilities, we can retrofit monitoring hardware to provide comprehensive tracking. During your free assessment, we'll confirm compatibility with your specific equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between basic and premium monitoring?",
      "answer": "Basic monitoring (often included with modern inverters) typically provides real-time production data and basic alerts. Premium monitoring adds panel-level performance tracking, advanced analytics, weather normalization, historical comparisons, carbon impact calculations, detailed financial reporting, expert review of your data, optimization recommendations, and priority technical support. We'll help you choose the right level for your needs and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can monitoring help me save more money in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Monitoring maximizes savings by detecting underperformance immediately (so issues are fixed quickly), identifying optimization opportunities, helping you time energy usage to maximize solar production usage, tracking actual savings vs. projections, alerting you to maintenance needs before they become expensive repairs, and providing data to support warranty claims if equipment fails."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does monitoring installation take?",
      "answer": "Most residential monitoring installations in Enfield take 2-4 hours, depending on system size and complexity. This includes installing any necessary hardware sensors, configuring the monitoring platform, setting up your user account, and providing training on how to use the system. The process is non-invasive and doesn't interrupt your solar system's operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What information will I see in my monitoring dashboard?",
      "answer": "Your dashboard displays current power production (in kilowatts), daily/monthly/yearly energy generation, system efficiency percentage, individual inverter or panel performance (with panel-level monitoring), battery charge levels (if applicable), real-time savings calculations, environmental impact metrics, weather data, performance vs. expected output, historical trends, and any active alerts or notifications about your system's status."
