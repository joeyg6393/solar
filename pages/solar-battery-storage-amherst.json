   "question": "How long will a battery power my Amherst home during an outage?",
   "answer": "A Tesla Powerwall stores 13.5 kWh of usable energy, sufficient to power essential circuits in most Amherst homes for 8-12 hours. For whole-home backup or longer duration coverage, we can install multiple Powerwalls. During our assessment, we'll calculate exact backup duration based on your household's specific energy consumption patterns."
  },

   "question": "How long does installation take in Amherst?",
   "answer": "Physical installation of battery storage systems typically takes 1-2 days for Amherst homes. The complete timeline from initial consultation to system activation averages 4-6 weeks, accounting for custom design, Town of Amherst permitting, equipment delivery, and installation scheduling."

   "question": "Will battery storage increase my Amherst home's value?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Research shows homes with solar-plus-storage systems command 3-4% price premiums in markets like Amherst. With Hampshire County's progressive, environmentally-conscious buyers, energy independence is a highly desirable feature. Battery storage is viewed as a premium upgrade in Amherst real estate."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I monitor and control my battery system remotely?",
   "answer": "Yes! All our installations include comprehensive monitoring accessible via smartphone app, tablet, or computer. You'll have real-time visibility into solar production, battery charge status, home consumption, and grid connection from anywhere. The system sends alerts and allows you to adjust settings for optimal performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens during a power outage in Amherst?",
   "answer": "When the grid fails in Amherst, your battery system instantly detects the outage and switches to backup mode within milliseconds - often unnoticeably fast. Your home continues operating on stored energy, and if it's daytime, your solar panels keep charging the batteries. The system automatically reconnects when grid power is restored."
