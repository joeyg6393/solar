 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does solar panel maintenance cost in Enfield, CT?",
   "answer": "Basic solar panel cleaning and inspection typically costs $175-$300 for residential systems in Enfield. Annual maintenance contracts that include multiple visits and priority service range from $299-$599 depending on system size. Many Enfield homeowners find annual maintenance plans offer the best value, especially since regular maintenance can increase energy production enough to pay for itself."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in a solar panel maintenance visit?",
   "answer": "Our comprehensive maintenance service includes professional panel cleaning, complete electrical system inspection, inverter testing and diagnostics, mounting hardware checks, connection tightening, performance measurement, monitoring system verification, and a detailed service report. We also identify any potential issues before they become expensive repairs, helping you avoid downtime."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if my solar panels need repair?",
   "answer": "Warning signs include sudden drops in energy production, error codes on your monitoring app, inverter warning lights, visible damage to panels, loose or damaged mounting hardware, and unexpectedly high electric bills. If your Enfield system is underperforming or you notice any of these issues, contact us for a free diagnostic assessment."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I clean my own solar panels or should I hire professionals?",
   "answer": "While some homeowners do clean their own panels, professional service is recommended for safety and effectiveness. We use specialized equipment, purified water systems, and techniques that prevent damage to protective coatings. More importantly, our maintenance includes comprehensive electrical and structural inspections that identify issues before they cause failures - something you can't safely do yourself."
  },
  {
   "question": "How often should solar panels be serviced in Enfield?",
   "answer": "We recommend annual professional maintenance for most Enfield solar systems. Properties with heavy tree coverage, near agricultural areas, or that experience significant bird activity may benefit from semi-annual service. Connecticut's seasonal changes - including spring pollen, summer storms, and winter snow - make regular professional maintenance especially valuable for maintaining peak performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency solar repair services in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide emergency repair services for urgent situations including storm damage, electrical failures, inverter malfunctions, and complete system outages. We understand that every day your Enfield solar system is down means lost energy production and higher utility costs. Our emergency team typically responds within 24 hours to restore your system safely and efficiently."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance help my solar panels last longer?",
   "answer": "Absolutely. Regular professional maintenance can extend your solar system's productive life by 5-10 years or more. Cleaning prevents efficiency loss, inspections catch small problems before they cause damage, and proper maintenance validates warranties. Most solar panels are designed to last 25-30 years, but neglected systems often experience failures much sooner. Maintenance is one of the best investments you can make in your Enfield solar system."
  },
  {
   "question": "What brands of solar equipment do you service?",
   "answer": "Our Enfield technicians are trained to service all major residential and commercial solar brands including SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, REC, Panasonic, and more. We work with all inverter types: string inverters (SMA, Fronius, SolarEdge), microinverters (Enphase, APsystems), and power optimizers. We maintain manufacturer relationships to ensure access to genuine parts and technical support."
