  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does West Springfield's river location affect my solar panels?",
      "answer": "The Connecticut River creates consistent humidity that attracts and holds airborne particles on panel surfaces. This humidity combines with pollen, road dust, and industrial particulates to create stubborn buildup that reduces efficiency by 20-30%. River valley conditions require more frequent cleaning than drier areas—typically 3 times annually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does traffic from I-91 really dirty my solar panels?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! West Springfield's position near I-91 and Route 5 exposes panels to constant road dust, exhaust particulates, and tire residue. Properties within a mile of major highways typically see 30-40% more buildup than suburban areas. This traffic-related soiling creates a film that rain can't remove effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much am I losing from dirty panels in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Most West Springfield solar systems lose $225-$475 annually in production from environmental buildup. A typical 7kW residential system produces about $1,200-$1,500 worth of electricity yearly, so 20-30% loss is significant. Professional cleaning costing $155-$290 provides immediate ROI plus long-term panel protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can humidity damage my solar panels over time?",
      "answer": "While panels are weather-sealed, West Springfield's humidity can accelerate certain degradation processes. Moisture can promote corrosion on connections, create conditions for mold/algae growth at panel edges, and help industrial particles bond more strongly to surfaces. Regular cleaning and inspection prevents these humidity-related issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't I just use my garden hose to clean panels?",
      "answer": "West Springfield has moderately hard water with minerals that leave spots and hazy films on panels, actually reducing efficiency. Our purified water system removes these minerals, leaving panels completely spot-free. Plus, improper DIY cleaning can force water into electrical connections or scratch panel surfaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you clean commercial solar installations in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Yes! We service numerous West Springfield commercial properties including retail centers, warehouses, and office buildings. Commercial arrays often face heavier soiling from traffic and require specialized access equipment. We offer competitive commercial rates and flexible scheduling to minimize business disruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your West Springfield maintenance packages?",
      "answer": "Our packages include 2-3 scheduled cleanings timed for post-pollen season, mid-summer, and fall. Each visit includes comprehensive inspection, performance testing, before/after documentation, priority scheduling, and detailed reports tracking your system's long-term health in West Springfield's environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "As a local company, we typically provide quotes within 24 hours and schedule most West Springfield cleanings within 3-5 business days. For emergencies like storm damage or severe production loss, we offer same-day service. Our proximity to West Springfield means we can respond faster than regional competitors."
