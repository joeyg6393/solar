 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should Suffield homeowners schedule solar maintenance?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional solar maintenance at least annually for Suffield residential systems. However, Connecticut's climate with humid summers and variable winters means biannual service is ideal - spring cleaning to remove pollen and winter debris, and fall maintenance to prepare for winter. Regular professional maintenance can improve energy production by 20-30% compared to neglected systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are warning signs my solar panels need professional service?",
   "answer": "Warning signs include: significant decrease in energy production compared to previous months, error messages on your inverter display, visible dirt or debris buildup on panels, physical damage like cracks or discoloration, loose or corroded electrical connections, moisture in junction boxes, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Suffield solar installation, contact us for prompt inspection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional solar panel cleaning worth the investment?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! In Suffield, environmental factors like pollen, dust, bird droppings, and seasonal debris can reduce solar panel efficiency by 20-30%. Professional cleaning safely removes these contaminants using proper equipment and techniques. For a typical Suffield solar system, the improved energy production quickly offsets the cleaning cost, making it a smart investment that pays for itself through increased savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you provide emergency solar repair services in Suffield?",
   "answer": "Yes! We offer 24/7 emergency solar repair service for critical issues including complete system failure, electrical hazards, inverter problems, and storm damage. Our Suffield-area emergency team typically responds within 4 hours during business hours and 6-8 hours for after-hours emergencies. We arrive fully equipped with common parts and diagnostic tools to resolve most issues on the first visit."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you service solar systems installed by other companies?",
   "answer": "Definitely! We maintain and repair all brands and types of solar installations throughout Suffield and North Central Connecticut, regardless of the original installer. Our NABCEP certified technicians are trained on all major solar equipment manufacturers and provide warranty-compliant service. Every Suffield solar system receives the same professional care and expertise."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance contract?",
   "answer": "Our Suffield annual maintenance contracts include: two comprehensive service visits (typically spring and fall), thorough professional panel cleaning, complete system inspection, inverter diagnostics and firmware updates, electrical safety testing, detailed performance reports, priority scheduling for emergency repairs, and 15% discount on any repair parts or labor needed throughout the year."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much do solar panel repairs cost in Suffield?",
   "answer": "Repair costs vary depending on the specific issue. Simple repairs like cleaning connections or resetting systems may be $150-300. Inverter component repairs range from $500-1,500. Full inverter replacement typically costs $1,500-3,500 depending on system size. Individual panel replacement is $300-600 per panel. We provide detailed estimates before starting any work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will professional maintenance void my solar warranty?",
   "answer": "No - professional maintenance actually protects your warranty. Many solar panel manufacturers require proof of regular professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. We provide detailed service documentation that meets all manufacturer requirements. Our maintenance procedures comply with warranty terms and industry best practices, ensuring your coverage remains valid throughout the warranty period."
