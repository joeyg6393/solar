  "Frequently Asked Questions About Commercial Solar"
 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "Can commercial solar really eliminate my Holland business energy bills?",
   "answer": "Yes! Many Holland businesses achieve 80-100% energy offset with properly sized commercial solar systems. After a typical 5-7 year payback period, you'll generate essentially free electricity for 20+ years. Even partial offset systems dramatically reduce bills while providing excellent ROI."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the right commercial solar system size for my Holland business?",
   "answer": "Optimal sizing depends on your energy usage, budget, and available space. We analyze your utility bills to determine consumption patterns, then design a system matching your needs. Systems range from 25kW for small businesses to 500kW+ for large industrial operations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does commercial solar installation take in Holland?",
   "answer": "Most Holland commercial projects complete in 6-10 weeks from contract to activation. Timeline includes design/engineering (1-2 weeks), Holland and Massachusetts permitting (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks), and inspections/utility approval (1-2 weeks)."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will installation disrupt my Holland business operations?",
   "answer": "Our process minimizes disruption. Most work occurs on rooftops or exterior areas. Brief electrical shutdowns (2-4 hours) required for final connections are scheduled during convenient off-peak times or weekends based on your preference."
  },
  {
   "question": "How well do solar panels work during Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Solar panels operate efficiently in cold weather and continue generating power throughout Massachusetts winters. While snow may occasionally cover panels temporarily, it typically melts quickly. Annual energy production consistently meets our projections for Holland locations."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the Massachusetts SMART program and how does it benefit my business?",
   "answer": "SMART provides monthly payments for solar energy production for 10-20 years, significantly improving ROI. Payment rates vary by system size and location. We handle complete SMART enrollment and management for all Holland commercial clients."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for commercial solar?",
   "answer": "We partner with leading commercial solar lenders offering various financing including term loans, capital leases, operating leases, and PPAs. Many Holland businesses choose ownership to maximize tax benefits. Most options provide immediate positive cash flow."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance does a commercial solar system require?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar requires minimal maintenance. We recommend annual inspections and occasional cleaning. Real-time monitoring alerts us to any performance issues. Many Holland businesses choose our maintenance programs for comprehensive care and priority service."
