  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will my Wales business see ROI on commercial solar?",
      "answer": "Most Wales businesses achieve complete payback in 5-7 years. With competitive pricing, MACRS depreciation, and Massachusetts SMART payments, your net investment is roughly half the system cost. After payback, you'll enjoy 20+ years of virtually free electricity - pure profit for your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size commercial solar system should my Wales business install?",
      "answer": "System sizing depends on your energy consumption, available space, and budget. Small businesses typically need 20-50kW, while larger operations require 100-500kW+. We analyze your utility bills and facility to recommend optimal sizing for fastest payback and maximum long-term returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the installation timeline for commercial solar in Wales?",
      "answer": "Most Wales commercial projects complete in 6-10 weeks total. This includes design/engineering (1-2 weeks), Wales and Massachusetts permitting (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks), and final inspections/utility approval (1-2 weeks). We provide detailed timelines during proposal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will installation disrupt my Wales business operations?",
      "answer": "We design our process to minimize disruption. Most installation work occurs on rooftops or exterior areas without impacting daily operations. Brief electrical shutdowns (2-4 hours) for final connections are scheduled during off-peak times based on your preference."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do solar panels perform during Massachusetts winters?",
      "answer": "Solar panels work efficiently in cold weather and continue generating power throughout Massachusetts winters. While snow may temporarily cover panels, it typically slides off quickly. Annual energy production consistently meets projections for Wales locations despite seasonal variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Massachusetts SMART program benefits?",
      "answer": "SMART provides monthly payments for solar production for 10-20 years, significantly improving ROI. Payment rates depend on system size and capacity block. We handle complete SMART enrollment and ongoing management for all Wales commercial clients."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I finance my commercial solar installation?",
      "answer": "Yes! We partner with multiple commercial solar financing companies offering loans, leases, and PPAs. Many Wales businesses prefer ownership through cash purchase or loans to capture full financial benefits. Most financing options provide immediate positive cash flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my solar system needs service?",
      "answer": "Our systems include comprehensive warranties: 25-year panel performance, 10-year workmanship, and 12-25 year inverter coverage. We offer maintenance agreements for Wales businesses including monitoring, inspections, and priority service. Solar systems require minimal maintenance."
