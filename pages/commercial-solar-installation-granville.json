 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What returns can my Granville business expect from solar investment?",
   "answer": "Granville businesses typically see 5-7 year complete payback followed by 20+ years of pure returns. Cumulative 25-year returns often exceed $600,000-$1,200,000 depending on system size. This represents exceptional ROI compared to most business investments that depreciate over time."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does solar investment compare to other business investments?",
   "answer": "Unlike most business investments that depreciate, commercial solar continues generating value for 25+ years. While equipment, vehicles, and technology lose value, your solar investment produces increasing returns as utility rates rise. Solar provides predictable, inflation-protected returns."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the upfront investment for commercial solar in Granville?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar investments range from $65,000 to $700,000+ based on system size. However, with competitive pricing, MACRS depreciation, and SMART revenue, your net investment is approximately 50% of list price. This one-time investment generates decades of returns."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know my 25+ year solar investment will perform as projected?",
   "answer": "Our systems include comprehensive warranties: 25-year panel performance guarantees, 10-year installation workmanship, and 12-25 year inverter coverage. We can also provide production guarantees ensuring your investment delivers projected returns. Solar is a proven, reliable investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I finance my solar investment to preserve capital?",
   "answer": "Yes! We work with commercial solar lenders offering various financing options. Many Granville businesses finance their solar investment, preserving capital while still achieving positive cash flow from day one. You can invest in solar without depleting business reserves."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens after 25 years - does my investment stop generating returns?",
   "answer": "No! Solar panels typically continue producing for 30-35+ years. The 25-year warranty is conservative - many panels operate efficiently for decades beyond warranty periods. Your investment continues generating returns well beyond the guaranteed 25-year period."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does SMART program revenue enhance my solar investment?",
   "answer": "Massachusetts SMART provides monthly payments for solar production for 10-20 years - additional revenue streams from your investment. These payments significantly boost ROI and accelerate payback. We handle complete SMART enrollment for all Granville commercial clients."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if my Granville business is sold - does new owner get the investment returns?",
   "answer": "Owned solar systems increase property value and transfer with the property. If you sell, the solar system enhances sale price. Alternatively, you can include solar revenue projections showing the new owner will inherit remaining investment returns, making your property more attractive."
