  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is monitoring especially important for Blandford's hilltown solar systems?",
      "answer": "Blandford's higher elevation and hilltown location create unique solar challenges including increased snow loads that can affect panels, variable weather patterns that impact production, terrain-specific shading from surrounding hills, and potential wind exposure. Professional monitoring accounts for these factors, provides elevation-adjusted benchmarks, detects snow coverage issues quickly, and ensures your system performs optimally despite hilltown challenges."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does monitoring handle Blandford's heavy winter snowfall?",
      "answer": "Our monitoring platform is essential during Blandford's snowy winters. It detects when snow coverage is significantly reducing production (alerting you when clearing would be beneficial), tracks snow load impacts on system performance, monitors cold temperature efficiency, identifies potential ice or snow damage issues, and provides realistic winter production expectations for your elevation. This helps you maintain maximum possible output during challenging winter months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I monitor my system if I'm not home?",
      "answer": "Yes, remote monitoring is perfect for Blandford residents who may travel during winter or own properties as vacation homes. Our mobile apps and web dashboards provide 24/7 access to your system's performance from anywhere. Check production, receive alerts, and monitor system health whether you're in town or away."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when monitoring detects issues?",
      "answer": "You receive instant alerts via email, text, or app notification with specific details about detected issues. Contact our team for expert evaluation - we can often diagnose problems remotely. If service is needed, we schedule a technician visit. This is especially valuable in Blandford where rapid response minimizes production loss during optimal solar conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is monitoring compatible with my solar equipment?",
      "answer": "Yes, our solutions work with all major brands including Enphase, SolarEdge, Tesla, Fronius, and more. For systems without built-in monitoring, we can retrofit hardware. We'll verify compatibility during your free assessment and recommend the best solution for your Blandford hilltown installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hilltown-specific optimization do you provide?",
      "answer": "Our optimization for Blandford includes elevation-adjusted performance strategies, snow management recommendations, terrain-specific shading analysis, cold weather efficiency optimization, wind exposure considerations, seasonal production planning for higher elevations, and maintenance scheduling tailored to hilltown conditions. These strategies can increase production by 5-15%."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does monitoring cost?",
      "answer": "Residential monitoring costs $15-30/month with installation fees of $300-800. Many modern inverters include basic monitoring at no charge. Premium platforms with hilltown-specific analytics available via subscription. We'll recommend the most cost-effective solution during your free assessment."
