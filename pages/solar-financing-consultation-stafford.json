  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available for Stafford, CT residents in 2024?",
   "answer": "Stafford homeowners can access the flexible financing options covering the complete system cost including installation. Connecticut also offers the SMART program providing solar renewable energy credits, net metering that credits your utility account for excess solar production, and various utility-specific rebates. Our consultation identifies every incentive applicable to your Stafford property for maximum savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options do you offer in Stafford?",
   "answer": "We provide multiple financing paths for Stafford residents: solar loans with 5-25 year terms and competitive rates starting at 2.99% APR, solar leases requiring no upfront cost with fixed monthly payments, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) where you pay only for electricity generated. Zero-down solar loans available for qualified applicants. During your free consultation, we determine which option provides optimal financial benefits for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much can Stafford homeowners save by installing solar?",
   "answer": "Savings vary based on current electricity usage, system size, and financing method, but most Stafford homeowners reduce electric bills by 65-95%. Over 25 years, cumulative savings typically range from $31,000 to $72,000. The competitive pricing immediately reduces system cost by thousands. We provide precise savings calculations based on your actual Stafford utility rates and consumption during consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What credit score is required for solar financing in Stafford?",
   "answer": "While credit scores of 650+ typically qualify for the best solar loan rates, we partner with multiple lenders serving various credit profiles. Even with less-than-perfect credit, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we assess your credit situation and identify the most suitable financing solutions for you."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does the solar financing approval process take in Stafford?",
   "answer": "From initial consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and financing applications usually receive approval within 5-7 business days. Once approved, solar installation in Stafford begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting and weather."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is your solar financing consultation really free for Stafford residents?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our Stafford solar financing consultation is 100% free with zero obligation to proceed. We provide complete property assessments, energy audits, financial projections, and incentive research at no cost. We believe in empowering homeowners through education for informed decision-making. You only move forward if the financial benefits clearly make sense for you."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Stafford home?",
   "answer": "If you own your system through a loan, you have several options when selling: pay off the remaining balance at closing, transfer the loan to the buyer with lender approval, or factor the payoff into your sale price. Research shows solar systems typically increase home value by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Stafford property more attractive to buyers. We discuss these scenarios thoroughly during consultation."
