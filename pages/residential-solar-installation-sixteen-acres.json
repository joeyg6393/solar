We manage everything and keep you informed throughout."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work during Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels are highly efficient in cold weather - they need sunlight, not heat.

We engineer all Sixteen Acres installations to handle Massachusetts snow loads and wind for reliable year-round performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties protect my Sixteen Acres solar installation?",
   "answer": "Your Sixteen Acres solar system includes comprehensive protection: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels guaranteeing 80-85% efficiency, 25-year inverter warranty, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and lifetime roof waterproofing warranty. We also guarantee projected energy production and net metering generation. All warranties are fully transferable if you sell your home."
