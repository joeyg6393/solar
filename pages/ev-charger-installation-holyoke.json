  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does EV charger installation take in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Holyoke take 3-5 hours for standard installations. This includes mounting the charger, installing the dedicated 240V circuit from your panel, and final testing. If your Holyoke home needs electrical panel upgrades, the installation may take 6-8 hours. We provide accurate timelines during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best EV charger for Holyoke's climate?",
      "answer": "For Holyoke's New England climate with cold winters, we recommend weatherproof chargers like Grizzl-E (rated -40°F to 122°F), ChargePoint Home Flex, or JuiceBox 48. These chargers handle Massachusetts weather perfectly. For indoor garage installations, Tesla Wall Connector and Wallbox Pulsar Plus are excellent choices. We'll recommend the best option for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I charge my EV with solar panels in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Holyoke receives excellent solar exposure, making solar-powered EV charging highly effective. We design integrated solar and EV charging systems that can power your vehicle with 100% renewable energy. This eliminates both gasoline and grid electricity costs, providing maximum savings and environmental benefits for Holyoke homeowners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my Holyoke home need electrical upgrades for an EV charger?",
      "answer": "It depends on your home's age and electrical panel capacity. Level 2 EV chargers require a dedicated 40-50 amp, 240V circuit. Most Holyoke homes built after 1990 can support this without major upgrades. Older homes, especially historic properties near downtown, may need panel upgrades. We provide free assessments to determine exactly what's needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What federal and state financing options are available in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Holyoke residents qualify for the federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, which covers 30% of installation costs up to $1,000. Massachusetts offers MOR-EV rebates for EV purchases, and some utility companies provide additional charger benefits. We help you navigate all available programs to maximize your savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which EV charger brands do you install in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "We install all major Level 2 EV charger brands including Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox 40/48, Grizzl-E, Wallbox Pulsar Plus, Emporia, and ClipperCreek. Each brand offers different features and price points. During your consultation, we'll help you choose the perfect charger for your EV model, budget, and smart home needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for EV charger installation in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Yes, Holyoke requires electrical permits for Level 2 EV charger installations to ensure safety and code compliance. We handle all permits, inspections, and paperwork with the Holyoke Building Department as part of our service. Our licensed electricians ensure your installation meets all Massachusetts electrical codes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to charge an EV at home in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "With Holyoke's average electricity rates around $0.22-0.24/kWh, fully charging a typical EV (60 kWh battery) costs approximately $13-15, providing 200-300 miles of range. That's equivalent to paying about $1.50 per gallon for gas! Smart chargers can reduce costs further by scheduling charging during off-peak hours. With solar panels, your charging costs approach zero."
