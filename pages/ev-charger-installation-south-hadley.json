  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does EV charger installation cost in South Hadley?",
      "answer": "EV charger installation in South Hadley typically costs $900-$2,500 total. This includes the Level 2 charger unit ($400-$900), professional installation labor ($400-$800), and electrical work ($200-$800).

    },
    {
      "question": "Which EV charger is best for my South Hadley home?",
      "answer": "The best charger depends on your EV model and charging needs. For Tesla owners, the Tesla Wall Connector offers seamless integration.

We'll recommend the perfect charger during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my South Hadley home need electrical upgrades for EV charging?",
      "answer": "It depends on your home's electrical panel capacity. Level 2 EV chargers require a dedicated 40-50 amp, 240V circuit. Most South Hadley homes built after 1990 have sufficient capacity. Older homes may need panel upgrades, which we handle completely including permits and Town of South Hadley inspections. We provide free assessments."

Outdoor installations work perfectly in South Hadley year-round. We ensure proper mounting, weatherproofing, and cable management for New England climate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for South Hadley residents?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How fast will my EV charge at home in South Hadley?",

A Tesla Model 3 charges in about 8 hours, a Nissan Leaf in 5-6 hours, and a Chevy Bolt in 7 hours with Level 2 charging."
    },
