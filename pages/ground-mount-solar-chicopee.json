 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space do I need for ground-mount solar in Chicopee?",
   "answer": "Most Chicopee residential ground-mount systems require 3,000-4,000 square feet of unshaded land for a typical 10kW installation. This is roughly the size of a large backyard or small portion of a larger property. During our free site assessment, we'll evaluate your Chicopee property and recommend the optimal system size and placement."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are ground-mount systems worth the extra cost in Chicopee?",
   "answer": "While ground-mount systems cost 10-15% more initially, they typically produce 10-25% more energy than rooftop systems due to optimal positioning and better airflow cooling. For Chicopee properties with challenging roof conditions, future roof replacement plans, or desire for maximum production, ground-mount systems often provide better long-term value."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits do I need in Chicopee for ground-mount solar?",
   "answer": "Chicopee ground-mount installations require building permits from the City of Chicopee and electrical permits. Depending on your property's zoning and system size, additional approvals may be needed. We handle all permitting and ensure full compliance with Chicopee's regulations as part of our comprehensive installation service."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Chicopee?",
   "answer": "Once permits are approved, typical residential ground-mount installations in Chicopee take 3-5 days. The permitting phase usually requires 4-8 weeks. We'll provide a complete timeline during your consultation and keep you updated throughout your Chicopee solar project."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can ground-mount solar handle Chicopee winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are engineered for New England weather, including Chicopee's snow and ice conditions. The elevated panel design allows snow to slide off easily, and easy ground access makes snow removal simple when needed. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations in winter."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for Chicopee solar installations?",
   "answer": "Chicopee residents qualify for the federal solar financing, Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production incentive payments), and property tax exemptions. These combined benefits can reduce your net system cost by 40-60%. We'll help you maximize all available Chicopee and Massachusetts solar benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add more panels to my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Ground-mount systems are easily expandable. We can design your initial Chicopee installation with future expansion in mind, allowing you to add capacity as your budget or energy needs grow. This flexibility is one of the key advantages of ground-mount solar."
