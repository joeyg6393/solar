 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space is required for ground-mount solar in Enfield?",
   "answer": "For a typical residential ground-mount solar system in Enfield (6-10 kW), you'll need approximately 600-2,000 square feet of land. The exact space depends on your energy needs and desired system size. Our team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your Enfield property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is ground-mount solar cost-effective compared to rooftop installation?",
   "answer": "While ground-mount systems have slightly higher upfront costs (typically 10-20% more), they often generate 15-25% more electricity due to optimal positioning. Combined with the competitive pricing and easier maintenance, many Enfield homeowners find ground-mount solar offers better long-term value, especially for properties with roof shading or structural concerns."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the zoning requirements for ground-mount solar in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Enfield has specific regulations for ground-mount solar including setback distances from property lines, height restrictions, and screening requirements. Our team is intimately familiar with Enfield's zoning codes and handles all permitting. We'll ensure your system complies with all local requirements during the design phase."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long will my ground-mount solar system last in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar systems are built to last 25-30+ years with minimal maintenance. The solar panels carry 25-year performance warranties, while racking structures and inverters typically last 15-25 years. Connecticut's weather is well within design parameters for our engineered systems. Many Enfield installations will continue producing energy for decades."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can ground-mount solar handle Enfield winters and snow?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are specifically engineered for Connecticut weather, including snow loads and wind conditions typical in Enfield. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing easier if needed. Many customers find snow slides off ground-mount panels faster than rooftop systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for Enfield ground-mount solar?",
   "answer": "We offer multiple financing solutions for Enfield residents including $0 down solar loans, cash purchases with maximum tax benefits, and lease options. With the competitive pricing, Connecticut benefits, and potential USDA grants for farms, ground-mount solar is more affordable than ever. Contact us to discuss the best financing option for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much energy can a ground-mount system produce in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Enfield receives excellent solar irradiance for ground-mount systems. A typical 10 kW ground-mount installation in Enfield produces 11,000-13,000 kWh annually - often enough to offset 80-100% of average household electricity usage. Actual production depends on system size, orientation, and site-specific factors. We provide detailed production estimates during the design phase."
