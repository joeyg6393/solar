  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is solar panel maintenance important in Somers, CT?",
      "answer": "Somers experiences typical Connecticut weather including significant seasonal pollen, occasional severe storms, and winter conditions that can impact solar performance. Regular maintenance removes efficiency-reducing debris, identifies wear before failures occur, and ensures your system operates at maximum capacity year-round. Proper maintenance can increase energy production by 15-25% and extend system life by 5-10 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between maintenance and repair services?",
      "answer": "Maintenance is proactive service designed to keep your Somers solar system running optimally and prevent problems - it includes cleaning, inspections, testing, and minor adjustments. Repairs are reactive services that fix problems after they occur, such as replacing failed inverters, repairing damaged panels, or correcting electrical issues. Regular maintenance significantly reduces the need for expensive repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I tell if my solar panels need professional cleaning?",
      "answer": "Visible signs include dirt buildup, bird droppings, pollen accumulation, or water spots on panels. Performance indicators include declining energy production, lower output than expected for current weather conditions, or decreasing returns compared to previous months. Even if panels look clean, professional maintenance includes inspection and testing that identifies hidden issues affecting efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide maintenance for commercial solar systems in Somers?",
      "answer": "Yes, we service both residential and commercial solar installations in Somers and throughout Tolland County. Commercial systems often benefit from more frequent maintenance due to their size and the higher cost of production losses. We offer customized maintenance contracts for commercial clients with flexible scheduling to minimize business disruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during a solar panel maintenance visit?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive Somers maintenance service includes: safe access and panel cleaning using purified water, complete visual inspection of panels and mounting hardware, electrical connection testing and tightening, inverter diagnostics and performance testing, monitoring system verification, thermal imaging (when applicable), performance measurement against expected output, and a detailed service report with photos and recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you repair solar panels damaged by storms in Somers?",
      "answer": "Yes, we handle all types of storm damage repairs including broken or cracked panels, damaged mounting systems, disconnected wiring, and inverter issues caused by power surges. We can assess damage for insurance claims and work directly with your insurance company. Our emergency service team can often respond same-day to make your Somers system safe and begin the repair process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is regular maintenance really worth the cost?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The cost of annual maintenance ($299-$649) is typically recovered through increased energy production within the first year. Maintenance prevents repairs that often cost $1,000-$3,000 or more, validates warranties (which may require proof of regular maintenance), and extends system life significantly. Most Somers solar owners find maintenance is one of their best investments in system performance and longevity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I schedule solar maintenance service in Somers?",
      "answer": "Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or use our online scheduling form. We'll discuss your system, answer any questions, and schedule a convenient appointment.
