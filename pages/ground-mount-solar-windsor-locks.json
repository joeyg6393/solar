  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land do I need for a ground-mount solar system in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "Typically, you need about 100-200 square feet per kilowatt of solar capacity. A standard residential system (6-10 kW) requires approximately 600-2,000 square feet of relatively flat, unshaded land. Our Windsor Locks team will assess your property during the free site evaluation to determine the optimal system size and placement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount solar systems more expensive than rooftop installations?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems typically cost 10-20% more than rooftop installations due to additional racking, foundation work, and trenching for underground electrical. However, they often produce 15-25% more energy due to optimal positioning, which can result in better long-term ROI. The competitive pricing applies to ground-mount systems just like rooftop installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a ground-mount solar system work on my Windsor Locks property?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar is ideal for Windsor Locks properties with available land, especially if you have roof shading issues, an older roof, or want maximum energy production. We'll conduct a free site assessment to evaluate sun exposure, soil conditions, setback requirements, and local zoning. Most residential and commercial properties in Windsor Locks are suitable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does ground-mount solar installation take in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "From contract signing to system activation, most ground-mount solar projects in Windsor Locks take 6-12 weeks. This includes permitting (2-4 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks). Weather and permit processing times can affect the timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount solar system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! One major advantage of ground-mount systems is expandability. We can design your initial installation with future expansion in mind, making it easy to add more panels as your energy needs grow or budget allows. This is much easier than expanding a rooftop system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does a ground-mount solar system require?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance. We recommend annual inspections and occasional panel cleaning (2-4 times per year). The ground-level accessibility makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Connecticut snow typically slides off angled panels naturally. We offer maintenance plans for Windsor Locks customers who prefer professional service."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any zoning restrictions for ground-mount solar in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "Windsor Locks has specific zoning regulations for ground-mount solar systems, including setback requirements from property lines and height restrictions. Our team is thoroughly familiar with local codes and handles all permitting. We'll ensure your system complies with all Windsor Locks and Connecticut regulations during the design phase."
