  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Most West Springfield residential ground-mount systems require approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet of unshaded land for a typical 10kW installation. This is roughly the size of a large backyard. During our free site assessment, we'll evaluate your West Springfield property and recommend the optimal system size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems worth the investment in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Yes! While ground-mount systems cost 10-15% more initially, they typically produce 10-25% more energy than rooftop systems due to optimal positioning. For West Springfield properties with roof limitations or those wanting maximum production, ground-mount systems provide excellent long-term value with faster ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required in West Springfield?",

    {
      "question": "Can ground-mount systems handle West Springfield winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are engineered for New England weather, including West Springfield's snow and ice conditions. The elevated panel design allows snow to slide off easily, and ground-level access makes snow removal simple when needed. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations in winter."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "West Springfield residents qualify for the competitive pricing, Massachusetts SMART program (10-20 years of production benefits), and property assessment exemptions.

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add more panels to my system later?",
