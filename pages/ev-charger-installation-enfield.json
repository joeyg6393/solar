  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What does EV charger installation cost in Enfield, CT?",
      "answer": "EV charger installation in Enfield typically costs between $800-$2,500. This includes the charger unit, electrical work, permit fees, and professional installation. Factors affecting price include distance from your electrical panel, whether panel upgrades are needed, and the charger model you select. The good news is that flexible benefits cover up to 30% of costs (maximum $1,000), significantly reducing your out-of-pocket expense. We provide free in-home consultations with detailed, transparent pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you install an EV charger at my Enfield home?",
      "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Enfield are completed within 3-7 business days from consultation to final activation. The actual installation work typically takes 3-5 hours for standard setups. If electrical panel upgrades are needed, we may schedule the work across two visits. We'll provide an accurate timeline during your free consultation and work around your schedule for minimal disruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I need to upgrade my electrical panel in Enfield?",
      "answer": "It depends on your home's current electrical capacity. Many homes in Enfield have 100-amp or 150-amp panels. Level 2 EV chargers typically require a dedicated 40-60 amp circuit. If your panel is near capacity or outdated, we may recommend upgrading to a 200-amp panel, which also future-proofs your home for additional electrical needs. Our free assessment will determine exactly what's needed for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which EV charger brand is best for my Enfield home?",
      "answer": "The best EV charger depends on your vehicle, budget, and desired features. For Tesla owners, the Tesla Wall Connector offers seamless integration. ChargePoint Home Flex is extremely popular for its reliability and smart features. JuiceBox offers excellent value with Wi-Fi connectivity. Grizzl-E is incredibly durable for Connecticut weather. During your consultation, we'll recommend the ideal charger based on your specific needs, vehicle type, and whether you want smart home integration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I charge any electric vehicle with a home charger in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Yes! All electric vehicles sold in the United States use the standard J1772 connector for Level 2 charging, making them compatible with all home EV chargers. Tesla vehicles come with a J1772 adapter, and Tesla Wall Connectors can also charge non-Tesla vehicles with the appropriate adapter. Whether you drive a Tesla, Chevy Bolt, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Nissan Leaf, BMW i4, or any other EV, we'll ensure your charger works perfectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install outdoor EV chargers in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We install both indoor garage chargers and outdoor driveway/carport chargers throughout Enfield. Outdoor installations use weather-resistant chargers rated for Connecticut's climate, including snow, rain, ice, and temperature extremes. We'll help you determine the best location based on where you park, your electrical panel location, and convenience factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required for EV charger installation in Enfield?",
      "answer": "EV charger installations in Enfield require an electrical permit from the Town of Enfield Building Department. We handle all permit applications on your behalf, including submitting required documentation and coordinating inspections. Our installations are always performed to meet or exceed Connecticut electrical code (NEC), ensuring they pass inspection on the first visit. Permit costs are typically included in our installation quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I integrate my EV charger with my solar panel system in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Yes! In fact, pairing an EV charger with a solar panel system is one of the smartest investments you can make. By generating your own electricity with solar panels, you can charge your EV with clean, renewable energy at minimal cost. We specialize in integrated solar and EV charging solutions and can design a system that powers both your home and vehicle. This combination maximizes your flexible benefits and long-term savings while reducing your carbon footprint."
