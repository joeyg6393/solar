 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much can I save with solar panels in Wilbraham?",
   "answer": "Wilbraham homeowners typically save 50-70% on electricity bills with solar panels. The average Wilbraham household saves $1,200-$2,000 annually on electricity costs. Over 25+ years, that's $30,000-$50,000 in total savings. With Massachusetts' net metering and net metering programs, your Wilbraham savings can be even higher."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available in Wilbraham, MA?",
   "answer": "Wilbraham residents benefit from excellent solar benefits: flexible financing options, Massachusetts Solar Renewable Energy Credits (net metering) worth $1,000-$3,000 per year, increased home value, professional service on equipment, and net metering credits at full retail rates. We help maximize your savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar installation take in Wilbraham?",
   "answer": "The physical installation on your Wilbraham home typically takes 1-3 days. The complete process from contract to activation averages 6-10 weeks, including custom design, Town of Wilbraham permitting, equipment procurement, and Eversource interconnection approval. We manage every step efficiently."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work during Wilbraham winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures. While winter days are shorter in Wilbraham, modern solar technology still produces significant energy even on cloudy days. Snow melts quickly on tilted panels. Wilbraham's excellent solar irradiance makes it ideal for year-round solar production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels increase my Wilbraham home's value?",
   "answer": "Yes! Studies show solar panels increase home values by $15,000-$25,000 on average in Massachusetts. Wilbraham homes with solar installations sell faster and at premium prices compared to similar non-solar homes. Solar is a major value-add that attracts environmentally conscious buyers."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if my Wilbraham roof needs replacement?",
   "answer": "We conduct a thorough roof assessment during your free consultation. If your Wilbraham home's roof is nearing end-of-life, we recommend replacement before solar installation. We can coordinate with trusted local roofers or handle roofing ourselves. Solar panels actually protect and extend roof lifespan."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I monitor my solar system's performance?",
   "answer": "Every installation includes real-time monitoring through intuitive smartphone apps. You can track energy production, consumption, and savings from anywhere. The system alerts you to any issues, and we remotely monitor all Wilbraham installations to ensure peak performance. Most homeowners check production daily!"
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens when I produce more energy than I use in Wilbraham?",
   "answer": "Massachusetts has excellent net metering policies. When your Wilbraham solar system generates more electricity than you consume, the surplus is fed to the grid and you receive full retail rate credits on your Eversource bill. Credits roll over month-to-month, so summer overproduction offsets winter usage."
