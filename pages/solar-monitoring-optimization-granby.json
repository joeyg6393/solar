 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How does solar monitoring save me money in Granby?",
   "answer": "Solar monitoring saves Granby homeowners money in multiple ways: detecting issues early (preventing $500-$1,000+ in lost production annually), optimizing energy usage to increase self-consumption by 15-20%, ensuring you receive proper net metering credits, and providing data for warranty claims. Most clients see 10-15% improvement in overall savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens if my solar panels stop working properly?",
   "answer": "Our system sends instant alerts via text, email, or app when production drops unexpectedly. Our support team reviews the issue and contacts you with specific recommendations. For Granby properties, we can typically provide on-site service within 6 hours for critical issues, preventing extended periods of lost production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is monitoring necessary for newer solar systems?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Even new systems can have installation issues, manufacturing defects, or gradual efficiency losses that go unnoticed without monitoring. Early detection during the warranty period ensures problems are fixed at no cost to you. Plus, monitoring helps you verify your installer's production estimates were accurate."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I monitor my Granby solar system remotely?",
   "answer": "Yes! Our platform is accessible from any smartphone, tablet, or computer with internet access. Whether you're at work, on vacation, or managing a rental property in Granby, you can check your system's performance in real-time and receive instant alerts wherever you are."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does monitoring help during Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Winter monitoring is crucial in Granby. Our system accounts for seasonal variations, tracks snow accumulation impacts, and alerts you when production should resume after snow events. This helps you know when manual snow removal is worthwhile and catches any ice damage or winter-related issues immediately."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will monitoring work with my battery storage system?",
   "answer": "Yes! We specialize in integrating monitoring with battery systems like Tesla Powerwall, LG Chem, and others. Our platform optimizes charging and discharge cycles based on your usage patterns, time-of-use rates, and weather forecasts, maximizing both your energy independence and cost savings in Granby."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does monitoring increase my home's value?",
   "answer": "Documented solar performance is a powerful selling point in Granby's real estate market. Our monitoring provides comprehensive reports showing production history, efficiency, and actual savings achieved. Homes with proven solar performance sell faster and command premium prices compared to those without documentation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if I'm not tech-savvy—is the platform easy to use?",
   "answer": "Our platform is designed for simplicity! Most Granby homeowners only need to glance at the main dashboard to see key metrics. We provide comprehensive training, and the system handles complex monitoring automatically. Our local support team is always available if you have questions or need assistance."
