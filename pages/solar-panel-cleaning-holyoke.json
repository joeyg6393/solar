  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Holyoke solar panels get dirtier than other areas?",
      "answer": "Holyoke's industrial history, proximity to the Connecticut River, and position in a valley create unique challenges. Industrial particulates from manufacturing, river humidity that attracts airborne contaminants, and surrounding forest pollen combine to create heavier buildup than suburban areas. Most Holyoke systems need cleaning 3 times annually versus 2 times in less industrial locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much energy am I losing from dirty panels in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Holyoke solar systems typically lose 25-35% efficiency from environmental buildup—higher than the regional average due to industrial exposure. For a typical 7kW Holyoke residential system, this translates to $250-$400 in lost annual production. Professional cleaning immediately restores this lost output."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can industrial pollutants damage my solar panels permanently?",
      "answer": "Without regular cleaning, yes. Some industrial particulates are acidic and can etch panel surfaces over time, causing permanent haze. Bird droppings combined with industrial fallout create corrosive compounds. Our regular maintenance prevents permanent damage by removing contaminants before they bond to panel surfaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you use special cleaning methods for Holyoke's industrial environment?",
      "answer": "Yes! We've developed specialized techniques after 12 years serving Holyoke. Our industrial-grade purified water system handles heavy particulate loads, and we use targeted pre-treatment for stubborn industrial buildup. We also extend dwell time for cleaning solutions to properly break down industrial contaminants without harsh chemicals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should commercial solar systems be cleaned in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Holyoke commercial installations, especially those on manufacturing facilities or near industrial zones, benefit from quarterly cleaning. The higher investment value and typically larger arrays make frequent maintenance cost-effective. We offer commercial contracts with scheduled cleanings and discounted rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will cleaning void my solar panel warranty in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Not when done professionally! DIY cleaning or using harsh chemicals can void warranties, but our manufacturer-approved methods are warranty-safe. We're certified in cleaning protocols for all major brands installed in Holyoke including LG, SunPower, Canadian Solar, REC, and Trina."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your Holyoke solar maintenance packages?",
      "answer": "Our Holyoke packages include 2-3 scheduled cleanings timed for post-pollen (spring), mid-summer, and fall. Each visit includes full system inspection, performance testing, before/after documentation, and priority scheduling. We also provide condition reports tracking long-term panel health in Holyoke's environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you clean solar panels on historic Holyoke mill buildings?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We have extensive experience with Holyoke's converted mill buildings and historic structures. Our team is trained in safe access methods for older buildings, and we work within historic preservation guidelines. We've successfully cleaned solar installations on several converted Holyoke mills."
