  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much money will commercial solar save my Enfield business?",
      "answer": "Enfield businesses typically save 60-65% on electricity costs with commercial solar. A 100kW system can save $18,000-$28,000 annually based on current Connecticut commercial electricity rates. Over 25 years, cumulative savings often exceed $600,000, providing exceptional ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the right solar system size for my Enfield commercial property?",
      "answer": "The optimal size depends on your energy usage, budget, and available space. Small offices might need 15-25kW, retail stores 30-75kW, while warehouses and manufacturing often require 150-500kW+. We analyze your specific situation to recommend the perfect size."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a commercial solar installation take in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Most Enfield commercial projects complete in 6-10 weeks from contract to activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), Enfield permitting (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks), and inspections (1-2 weeks). We manage timelines to minimize business impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will installation interfere with my Enfield business operations?",
      "answer": "We plan installations to minimize disruption. Roof work typically doesn't affect interior operations. Brief electrical shutdowns (2-4 hours) are scheduled during convenient times. Most Enfield businesses operate normally throughout the installation process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does solar perform during Connecticut winters?",
      "answer": "Solar panels work efficiently in cold weather and continue generating power year-round in Enfield. While winter days are shorter and occasional snow may temporarily cover panels, annual production meets our projections. Panels are engineered for Connecticut snow loads and ice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I finance my commercial solar system?",
      "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple commercial solar financing partners offering loans, leases, and PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements). Many Enfield businesses prefer loans to capture financial benefits directly. Financing often results in positive cash flow from day one."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does a commercial solar system require?",
      "answer": "Commercial solar systems require minimal maintenance. We recommend annual inspections and occasional panel cleaning for optimal performance. Our monitoring systems alert us to any issues. Many Enfield businesses choose our maintenance plans for peace of mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my Enfield building is suitable for solar?",
      "answer": "Most commercial buildings in Enfield are excellent candidates for solar. We evaluate roof condition, age, orientation, shading, and structural capacity during our free assessment. Even challenging sites often have viable solutions like ground-mount or carport systems."
