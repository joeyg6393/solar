Holland homeowners can sell these in Massachusetts' net metering market for additional income. Over 10 years, Holland solar owners typically earn $2,500-$4,500 in net metering income on top of electric bill savings. We handle all net metering enrollment and tracking."

Combined with $2,500-$4,500 in net metering income over 10 years, total savings over 25-30 years typically exceed $70,000-$90,000.

  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar installation take in Holland?",

We manage the entire process and keep you informed at every step."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work in Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Yes! Solar panels are highly efficient in cold weather. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed to shed snow quickly, and cold temperatures actually improve panel efficiency. We engineer all Holland installations to handle heavy Massachusetts snow loads, ice, and wind for reliable year-round performance and net metering generation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties protect my Holland solar installation?",
   "answer": "Your Holland solar system includes comprehensive coverage: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels, 25-year inverter warranty, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and lifetime roof waterproofing warranty. We also guarantee your system will produce the projected energy and net metering income. All warranties are fully transferable if you sell."
