 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "Why is owning power better than renting it from utilities?",
   "answer": "Owning your power with commercial solar means predictable costs for 25+ years versus ever-increasing utility rates. After a 5-7 year payback, you own a valuable energy asset providing free electricity. Over 25 years, ownership saves Russell businesses $500,000-$1,000,000+ compared to renting utility power."
  },
  {
   "question": "What does it cost to own my Russell business's power supply?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar ownership in Russell ranges from $65,000 to $600,000+ depending on system size. However, with competitive pricing, MACRS depreciation, and SMART payments, your net investment is approximately 50% of list price. Compare this one-time investment to 25+ years of utility bills."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long until I own my power outright?",
   "answer": "Most Russell businesses achieve complete solar system payback in 5-7 years. After that, you own a fully-paid energy asset that continues producing free electricity for 20+ additional years. If financed, you can own your power with positive cash flow from day one."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens if my owned solar system needs repairs?",
   "answer": "Your owned solar asset includes comprehensive warranties: 25-year panel performance, 10-year installation workmanship, and 12-25 year inverters. Most repairs are covered. We also offer maintenance agreements for Russell businesses providing monitoring, inspections, and priority service."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I finance my transition to power ownership?",
   "answer": "Yes! We work with commercial solar lenders offering various financing options. Many Russell businesses finance their transition to energy ownership, with monthly payments typically lower than current utility costs - meaning immediate positive cash flow while building an owned asset."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does Massachusetts SMART program benefit energy ownership?",
   "answer": "SMART provides monthly payments for your owned solar production for 10-20 years. These payments represent additional revenue from your owned energy asset, significantly improving ROI and accelerating payback. We manage complete SMART enrollment for Russell businesses."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if my Russell business uses more energy in the future?",
   "answer": "We can design your owned system with expansion capability. Many Russell businesses start with partial ownership (offsetting 60-80% of usage) and expand later. You can also add battery storage to your owned system for complete energy independence."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does owned solar affect my Russell property value?",
   "answer": "Owned commercial solar systems increase property value significantly. Studies show commercial properties with owned solar sell for premium prices and lease for higher rates. Your solar ownership is a valuable business asset that enhances property worth."
