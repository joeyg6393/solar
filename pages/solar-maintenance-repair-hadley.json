  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does agricultural dust affect solar panels in Hadley?",
      "answer": "Hadley's agricultural activities, especially during planting and harvest seasons, create significant dust that settles on solar panels and can reduce efficiency by 20-35%. Regular professional cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance. We recommend quarterly cleaning for agricultural solar installations in Hadley to combat dust accumulation and maximize energy production."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you specialize in farm solar system maintenance?",
      "answer": "Yes! We have extensive experience maintaining agricultural solar installations throughout Hadley and the Connecticut River Valley. We understand the unique challenges farms face including dust, pollen, equipment operation near solar arrays, and the critical importance of minimizing downtime. Our team works efficiently around farming schedules and uses agricultural-safe cleaning products."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should Hadley solar systems be professionally maintained?",
      "answer": "For residential systems in Hadley, we recommend annual professional maintenance. Agricultural installations should be serviced 2-4 times annually depending on location and exposure to dust and debris. Systems near active fields benefit from quarterly cleaning and inspection. We'll assess your specific situation and recommend an optimal maintenance schedule for your Hadley property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can wildlife damage solar panels?",
      "answer": "Yes, wildlife common in Hadley's rural areas can damage solar installations. Birds may nest under panels, squirrels can chew wiring, and woodpeckers may damage panel frames. We inspect for wildlife damage during maintenance visits and can install deterrents like critter guards and bird netting to protect your investment without harming local wildlife."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my solar system fails during farming operations?",
      "answer": "We understand that solar downtime can impact farm operations, especially for systems powering irrigation, cooling, or other critical equipment. That's why we offer same-day emergency service for Hadley agricultural customers. Our rapid response team arrives equipped to diagnose and repair most issues on the first visit, minimizing disruption to your farming activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you service ground-mount solar systems in Hadley?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Ground-mount systems are common on Hadley farms, and we're experts in their maintenance and repair. Ground-mount systems face unique challenges including vegetation growth, animal interference, and ground shifting. Our service includes vegetation management consultation, mounting structure inspection, and ensuring optimal panel angles for seasonal sun positions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will spring pollen season damage my Hadley solar panels?",
      "answer": "Spring pollen won't permanently damage panels, but the heavy pollen season in Hadley's Connecticut River Valley can create a thick coating that severely reduces solar output. We recommend scheduling cleaning service in late spring (May) to remove pollen buildup and restore peak performance. This single cleaning can improve production by 25% or more during high-production summer months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with solar system expansion for growing farm operations?",
      "answer": "Yes! In addition to maintenance and repair, we can assess your current solar system's capacity and design expansions to meet growing energy needs. Many Hadley farms are expanding their solar arrays to power additional equipment or generate excess power for revenue. We'll evaluate your property and provide recommendations for cost-effective system expansion."
