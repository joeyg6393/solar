 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does solar installation cost in Wales, MA?",

With zero-down financing and net metering income, monthly costs are significantly lower than electric bills."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much net metering income can Wales homeowners earn?",
   "answer": "Wales solar owners earn Solar Renewable Energy Credits (net metering) for every 1,000 kWh produced. Over 10 years, Wales homeowners typically earn $2,800-$5,000 selling these credits in Massachusetts' net metering market. This is in addition to electric bill savings. We handle all net metering enrollment, tracking, and provide guidance on selling your credits."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are total savings with solar in Wales?",
   "answer": "Wales homeowners save $2,100-$2,900 annually on electricity. Combined with $2,800-$5,000 in net metering income over 10 years, total savings over 25-30 years typically exceed $75,000-$95,000. Massachusetts' generous net metering provides full retail credits for excess energy, maximizing your financial benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is my Wales property good for solar?",
   "answer": "Most Wales homes are excellent for solar! We install on various roof types and offer ground-mount systems perfect for Wales' rural properties with available land. During your free consultation, we'll evaluate your specific property including roof condition, orientation, shading, and recommend the optimal solar solution for maximum energy production and net metering generation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar installation take in Wales?",
   "answer": "Physical installation takes 1-3 days for most Wales homes. The complete process from contract to activation averages 6-10 weeks, including design, Town of Wales permits, equipment delivery, installation, inspection, National Grid interconnection, and net metering enrollment. We manage everything and keep you informed throughout."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work well in Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels are highly efficient in cold weather - they need sunlight, not heat. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed to shed snow quickly. Cold temperatures actually improve panel efficiency. We engineer all Wales installations to handle heavy Massachusetts snow loads, ice, and wind for year-round production and net metering generation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties protect my Wales solar installation?",
   "answer": "Your Wales solar system includes comprehensive protection: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels guaranteeing 80-85% efficiency, 25-year inverter warranty, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and lifetime roof waterproofing warranty. We also guarantee projected energy production and net metering generation. All warranties transfer if you sell your Wales home."
