 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in Ludlow?",
   "answer": "Most Ludlow residential ground-mount systems require approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet of unshaded land for a typical 10kW installation. This is roughly the size of a large backyard. During our free site assessment, we'll evaluate your Ludlow property and recommend the optimal system size and placement."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are ground-mount systems worth the investment in Ludlow?",
   "answer": "Yes! While ground-mount systems cost 10-15% more initially, they typically produce 10-25% more energy than rooftop systems due to optimal positioning and better cooling. For Ludlow properties with roof limitations or those wanting maximum production, ground-mount systems offer excellent long-term value and faster ROI."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are required in Ludlow for ground-mount solar?",
   "answer": "Ludlow ground-mount installations require building permits from the Town Building Department and electrical permits. Depending on your property's zoning and system size, additional approvals may be needed. We handle all permitting and ensure compliance with Ludlow's regulations as part of our comprehensive service."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Ludlow?",
   "answer": "After permit approval, most residential ground-mount installations in Ludlow take 3-5 days to complete. The permitting process typically requires 4-8 weeks. We provide a complete timeline during your consultation and keep you informed throughout your Ludlow solar project."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do ground-mount systems handle Ludlow winters well?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are engineered for New England weather, including Ludlow's snow and ice conditions. The elevated panel design allows snow to slide off naturally, and ground-level access makes snow removal simple when needed. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations during winter months."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for Ludlow solar installations?",
   "answer": "Ludlow residents qualify for the federal solar financing, Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production incentive payments), and property tax exemptions. Combined, these benefits can reduce your net system cost by 40-60%. We help you maximize all available Ludlow and Massachusetts solar benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Ground-mount systems are easily expandable. We can design your initial Ludlow installation with future expansion in mind, allowing you to add panels as your budget or energy needs grow. This flexibility is a key advantage of ground-mount solar systems."
