      "answer": "Brimfield businesses typically save 65-70% on electricity costs with commercial solar. Annual savings range from $15,000 to $45,000+ depending on system size.

    },
    {
      "question": "What size commercial solar system does my Brimfield business need?",
      "answer": "System sizing depends on your energy consumption, available space, and budget. Small businesses might need 20-40kW, while larger facilities often require 100-500kW or more. We analyze your utility bills and property to recommend the optimal size for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does commercial solar installation take in Brimfield?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Will installation disrupt my Brimfield business operations?",

      "question": "What is the Massachusetts SMART program?",
      "answer": "The Massachusetts Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program provides monthly payments for solar energy production, typically for 10-20 years. These payments significantly improve ROI. We handle all SMART program enrollment and documentation for Brimfield businesses."
    },

      "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple commercial solar financing partners offering loans, leases, and PPAs. Many Brimfield businesses choose ownership through cash purchase or loans to capture full financial benefits. Most financing options provide positive cash flow from day one."
    },
