 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should solar panels be cleaned in Agawam?",
   "answer": "Agawam's environment typically requires 2-3 professional cleanings annually. We recommend spring cleaning (after pollen season), mid-summer (after dust accumulation from Six Flags and commercial activity), and fall (before winter). Properties near Routes 57/159 or commercial zones may benefit from quarterly cleaning."
  },
  {
   "question": "Does dust from Six Flags and commercial areas really affect my solar panels?",
   "answer": "Yes, significantly! Agawam's attractions and commercial zones generate considerable airborne dust and particulates. Combined with vehicle traffic on nearby roads, this creates layers of buildup that can reduce efficiency by 20-30%. Professional cleaning removes these stubborn deposits that rain alone cannot eliminate."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the ROI on professional solar panel cleaning in Agawam?",
   "answer": "Excellent! Most Agawam solar systems lose $200-$450 yearly from dirty panels. Our cleaning costs $150-$285 and typically restores 20-25% efficiency immediately—paying for itself within 2-4 months. Plus, regular cleaning extends panel lifespan, protecting your entire solar investment worth $15,000-$30,000+."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I clean my own solar panels to save money?",
   "answer": "We don't recommend it. DIY cleaning risks include: scratching panels with improper materials, mineral deposits from tap water, voiding warranties with harsh chemicals, safety hazards on roofs, and missing damage that professionals would catch. Our service is affordable and eliminates all these risks."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does Agawam's humidity affect solar panel efficiency?",
   "answer": "Connecticut River valley humidity creates two problems: it attracts airborne particles that stick to panels more easily, and it can promote algae/mold growth at panel edges. This humidity-enhanced buildup reduces efficiency more than dry climates. Our purified water cleaning addresses both issues effectively."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service commercial solar installations in Agawam?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We clean numerous Agawam commercial properties including retail centers, office buildings, and industrial facilities. Commercial arrays often require specialized access equipment and extended service hours. We offer competitive commercial rates and can schedule around your business operations."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your Agawam maintenance packages?",
   "answer": "Our packages include 2-3 scheduled cleanings timed optimally for Agawam's seasons, comprehensive inspections at each visit, performance tracking, before/after documentation, priority scheduling, and detailed condition reports. Annual plans start at $450 for residential systems—significant savings over individual cleanings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you identify problems with my solar system during cleaning?",
   "answer": "Yes! Our certified technicians inspect all visible components during every cleaning. We check for micro-cracks in panels, loose or corroded connections, damaged weather seals, mounting hardware issues, and performance irregularities. Early detection prevents small problems from becoming expensive repairs."
