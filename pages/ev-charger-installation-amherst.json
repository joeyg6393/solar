 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does EV charger installation cost in Amherst?",
   "answer": "EV charger installation in Amherst typically costs between $1,300-$1,900 for most standard installations. This includes the Level 2 charger unit, all necessary materials, professional installation labor, and permits. Costs can vary based on the charger model you select, the distance from your electrical panel to the installation location, and whether any electrical upgrades are needed. We provide detailed, transparent quotes during your free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 EV charging?",
   "answer": "Level 1 charging uses a standard 120V household outlet and adds about 3-5 miles of range per hour - sufficient for plug-in hybrids but slow for full EVs. Level 2 charging uses 240V (like your dryer) and adds 20-35 miles of range per hour, allowing you to fully charge overnight. For Amherst residents with electric vehicles, Level 2 is the recommended solution for convenient, practical home charging."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I install an EV charger if I have an older Amherst home?",
   "answer": "Yes! While older Amherst homes may have 100-amp electrical panels that require upgrading to accommodate an EV charger, we regularly perform these upgrades. During our free consultation, we'll assess your current electrical system and provide recommendations. Many older homes in Amherst's historic neighborhoods have been successfully upgraded to support modern EV charging."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does the installation take?",
   "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Amherst are completed in 4-6 hours for homes with adequate electrical capacity and straightforward installation locations. If electrical panel upgrades are required, the complete project typically takes 1-2 days. We work efficiently to minimize disruption while ensuring the highest quality installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will an EV charger work with my solar panels?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We specialize in integrating EV chargers with solar panel systems, allowing you to charge your vehicle with clean, renewable energy. Many environmentally-conscious Amherst residents pair solar panels with EV chargers for a completely sustainable transportation solution. Smart chargers can be programmed to charge during peak solar production, maximizing your use of self-generated solar energy."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are needed for EV charger installation in Amherst?",
   "answer": "EV charger installations in Amherst require an electrical permit from the Town of Amherst Building Department. We handle all permit applications and submissions on your behalf, schedule required inspections, and ensure your installation meets all local codes and Massachusetts state electrical requirements. Permit fees are typically included in our installation quotes."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I get financing options or rebates for installing an EV charger?",
   "answer": "Yes! The federal government offers financings covering up to 30% of EV charger installation costs (up to $1,000 for residential installations). Massachusetts also periodically offers state rebates through programs like MOR-EV. Some utility companies provide additional benefits. We stay updated on all available programs and help you access every rebate and credit you qualify for."
  },
  {
   "question": "Which EV charger brand do you recommend for Amherst winters?",
   "answer": "For Amherst's cold winters, we recommend chargers specifically rated for outdoor use in extreme temperatures, such as the Grizzl-E (rated to -22°F), JuiceBox 40 (rated to -22°F), or Tesla Wall Connector (rated to -22°F). All outdoor installations are properly sealed and protected to withstand snow, ice, and temperature extremes common in Western Massachusetts."
