 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How long does it take to install an EV charger at my Northampton home?",
   "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Northampton are completed in 4-6 hours for straightforward installations. If electrical panel upgrades are needed, the project may take 1-2 days. We schedule installations at your convenience and complete all work efficiently while maintaining the highest quality standards."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I charge any electric vehicle with a home charging station?",
   "answer": "Yes! Level 2 EV chargers use the standard J1772 connector that works with all electric vehicles sold in North America, including Tesla (with the included adapter), Ford, Chevrolet, Rivian, Nissan, Hyundai, and all other EV brands. Tesla vehicles can also use the proprietary Tesla Wall Connector for faster charging speeds."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need to upgrade my electrical panel for an EV charger?",
   "answer": "Many Northampton homes built in the last 20 years have 200-amp electrical panels with sufficient capacity for an EV charger. However, older homes with 100-amp panels or homes with high electrical loads may require an upgrade. We assess your panel during the free consultation and provide recommendations if upgrades are needed."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much faster is a Level 2 charger compared to a regular outlet?",
   "answer": "Level 2 chargers (240V) are 4-7 times faster than standard 120V outlets. While a regular outlet might add 3-5 miles of range per hour, a Level 2 charger can add 20-35 miles of range per hour, allowing you to fully charge your EV overnight. For most Northampton residents, this means plugging in when you get home and having a full charge by morning."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can my EV charger work with my solar panel system?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We specialize in integrating EV chargers with existing solar panel systems in Northampton. This allows you to charge your vehicle with clean, renewable energy produced by your own solar panels. We can install smart chargers that optimize charging during peak solar production hours, maximizing your use of solar energy."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are required for EV charger installation in Northampton?",
   "answer": "EV charger installations in Northampton require an electrical permit from the City of Northampton Building Department. We handle all permit applications, schedule required inspections, and ensure your installation meets all local and Massachusetts state electrical codes. The permit cost is typically included in our installation quote."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are there rebates or financing options available for EV charger installation?",
   "answer": "Yes! The federal government offers financings for EV charger installations, and Massachusetts periodically offers state-level rebates through programs like MOR-EV. Additionally, some utility companies offer benefits for EV charger installation. We stay current on all available programs and help you access any rebates or credits you qualify for."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can the charger be installed outdoors in Northampton weather?",
   "answer": "Yes, we install weather-resistant, outdoor-rated EV chargers that can withstand Northampton's full range of weather conditions, from hot summers to cold, snowy winters. All outdoor installations are properly sealed and protected according to National Electric Code requirements for outdoor electrical equipment."
