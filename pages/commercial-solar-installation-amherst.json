 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much money can my Amherst business save with commercial solar?",
   "answer": "Amherst businesses typically reduce electricity costs by 60-70% immediately after solar installation. Over 25 years, savings commonly exceed $400,000-$600,000 depending on your system size and energy consumption. With net metering, the flexible financing, Massachusetts SMART program, and accelerated depreciation, the financial benefits are exceptional. We provide a customized ROI analysis showing exactly what your business will save."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available for Massachusetts businesses?",
   "answer": "Massachusetts offers outstanding solar benefits: federal Investment financing (financing) which directly reduces your taxes, SMART program incentive payments for the energy you produce, 5-year accelerated depreciation (MACRS) allowing you to depreciate 85% of the system cost, and net metering that credits you for excess power. These combined benefits can reduce your effective cost by 50% or more within the first year."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does a commercial solar installation take in Amherst?",
   "answer": "Most commercial solar projects in Amherst are completed within 2-4 months from contract signing to system activation. This timeline includes engineering and design (2-3 weeks), permitting with Town of Amherst (4-6 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks based on system size), and utility interconnection approval (2-4 weeks). We coordinate every phase and minimize any impact on your business operations."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels produce enough power during Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Yes! While winter days are shorter, solar panels actually operate more efficiently in cold temperatures. Modern solar panels can generate substantial power even on cloudy days. Snow typically melts or slides off angled panels quickly. Your system is designed to produce optimal annual energy based on Amherst's actual weather patterns, and excellent summer production more than compensates for shorter winter days."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can we finance commercial solar for our Amherst business?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We offer multiple financing solutions: traditional cash purchase (best long-term savings), commercial solar loans (own the system with no money down and keep all tax benefits), Power Purchase Agreements where you pay only for the solar power produced with zero upfront cost, and solar leases. Each option has different advantages depending on your business's tax situation and cash flow needs."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance do commercial solar panels require?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar systems are remarkably low-maintenance. Rain naturally cleans the panels in most cases, and the systems have no moving parts. We include real-time monitoring that alerts us to any performance issues immediately. We recommend an annual inspection to verify all electrical connections and optimize performance. Our 10-year workmanship warranty and 25-year panel warranties provide long-term protection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is my Amherst building suitable for commercial solar installation?",
   "answer": "Most Amherst commercial buildings are excellent solar candidates! During our free assessment, we evaluate your roof age, condition, orientation, available space, shading from trees or buildings, and structural integrity. If your roof isn't ideal, we can design ground-mount systems or solar carport structures. Buildings with unshaded south, southwest, or west-facing roof areas work best, but we've successfully installed systems on a wide variety of properties."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can we add battery storage to our commercial solar system?",
   "answer": "Yes! Commercial battery storage is increasingly popular among Amherst businesses for backup power during outages, reducing demand charges, and achieving complete energy independence. We install commercial-grade battery systems scaled to your needs, from small backup systems for critical operations to large installations that can power your entire facility. Battery storage also qualifies for the competitive pricing."
