 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much do solar panels cost in Enfield, Connecticut?",
   "answer": "Solar panel installation in Enfield typically costs $16,000-$36,000 before benefits for a complete residential system. After the competitive pricing, your net cost ranges from $12,000-$27,000. The exact price depends on your home's energy consumption, roof characteristics, and desired system size. With zero-down financing, monthly solar loan payments are often lower than your current Eversource electric bills."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much will I save on electricity with solar panels in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Enfield homeowners save an average of $1,500-$2,600 per year on electricity after installing solar panels. Over 25 years, total savings typically exceed $45,000-$70,000 when accounting for Connecticut's high electricity rates and annual utility increases. Connecticut's net metering policy maximizes your savings by providing credits for excess energy your system produces."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is my Enfield home suitable for solar panel installation?",
   "answer": "Most Enfield homes are excellent candidates for solar! We can install on various roof types including asphalt shingle, metal, tile, and even flat roofs. Ideal conditions include a roof with 15+ years remaining lifespan, south or southwest orientation, and minimal shading. During your free assessment, we'll evaluate your specific property and can recommend ground-mount systems if rooftop installation isn't optimal."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does it take to install solar panels on an Enfield home?",
   "answer": "The physical installation on your Enfield home takes 1-3 days for most residential systems. The complete process from contract signing to system activation averages 5-10 weeks, including custom design, permitting with the Town of Enfield, equipment delivery, installation, inspection, and Eversource interconnection approval. We coordinate all steps and keep you informed throughout."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work during Connecticut winters in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels actually perform efficiently in cold weather - it's bright sunlight they need, not heat. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed to shed snow quickly, and the dark surface helps accelerate melting. We engineer all Enfield installations to handle Connecticut snow loads and maximize year-round energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels increase my home's value in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Yes! According to Zillow, homes with solar panels sell for 4.1% more on average than comparable homes without solar. For a typical Enfield home valued at $350,000, that translates to roughly $14,000 in added value. Solar homes also tend to sell faster. It's an investment that pays dividends now through energy savings and later through increased property value."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties protect my Enfield solar installation?",
   "answer": "Your Enfield solar system includes comprehensive coverage: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels guaranteeing 80-85% production efficiency, 25-year warranty on inverter equipment, 10-year workmanship guarantee on our installation quality, and a lifetime warranty on roof waterproofing. We also provide production guarantees ensuring your system generates the predicted energy. All warranties are fully transferable if you sell your home."
