    {
      "question": "What is the cost of solar roof installation in Tolland, CT?",
      "answer": "Solar roof installation in Tolland typically ranges from $44,000-$88,000 before benefits, depending on roof size, pitch, and system capacity. With the competitive pricing, you'll save $11,440-$22,880 immediately. Connecticut solar benefits provide additional savings. Most Tolland homeowners achieve complete payback in 12-16 years through annual electricity savings averaging $2,500-$4,500."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do solar roofs last in Connecticut weather?",
      "answer": "Our solar roofs are engineered for Connecticut's demanding climate. Solar shingles last 25-30+ years with minimal maintenance, far outlasting traditional asphalt shingles (15-20 years). They're three times stronger than standard roofing with Class A fire rating and superior resistance to hail, wind, heavy snow, and temperature extremes common in Tolland."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a solar roof work during Tolland's snowy winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs perform well year-round in Tolland. Dark solar shingles absorb heat and help snow melt faster than traditional roofing. While production is lower during short winter days, annual production is optimized for Connecticut's climate. Our systems are designed to handle heavy snow loads typical of Tolland County winters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I afford a solar roof with financing options?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We offer $0 down solar loans, home equity financing, and PACE programs for Tolland homeowners. With the competitive pricing and Connecticut benefits, combined with immediate electricity savings, most customers achieve positive cash flow from day one. Monthly loan payments are typically less than current electricity bills."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much value does a solar roof add to my Tolland home?",
      "answer": "Studies show solar installations increase home values by $20,000-$40,000 on average in Connecticut. Solar roofs add even more because they combine a brand-new roof with energy generation. Tolland homes with solar sell faster and command premium prices, especially as energy costs continue rising."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required for solar roof installation in Tolland?",
      "answer": "Solar roof installations in Tolland require building permits from the town building department and electrical permits. We handle all permitting, inspections, and utility interconnection agreements with Eversource. Our team has extensive experience with Tolland's requirements, ensuring smooth approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my Tolland solar roof?",
      "answer": "Yes! We recommend pairing solar roofs with battery storage systems like Tesla Powerwall for maximum energy independence. Battery backup stores excess solar production for use at night or during power outages - especially valuable during Connecticut winter storms. We design integrated solar roof + battery systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do solar roofs compare to traditional solar panels?",
      "answer": "Solar roofs offer superior aesthetics (integrated vs. mounted), complete roof replacement, and often better warranties. They're ideal if your Tolland home needs a new roof anyway, you value curb appeal, or want cutting-edge technology. Traditional panels are more economical if your roof is in good condition. We'll help you choose during your free consultation."
