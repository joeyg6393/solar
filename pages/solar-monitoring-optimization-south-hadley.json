 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "Why is solar monitoring important for South Hadley homeowners?",
   "answer": "South Hadley's variable weather and geographic diversity make monitoring essential for protecting your solar investment. Without monitoring, you won't know if panels are failing, if there are wiring issues, or if your system has stopped producing altogether. South Hadley clients with monitoring detect problems 4-6 weeks earlier on average, preventing significant energy losses."
  },
  {
   "question": "What problems can monitoring detect in South Hadley solar systems?",
   "answer": "Our monitoring identifies inverter failures, individual panel malfunctions, shading from tree growth, wiring issues, grid connection problems, and gradual performance degradation. For South Hadley installations near the Connecticut River, we also track weather-related impacts and elevation-related performance variations."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you add monitoring to my existing South Hadley solar panels?",
   "answer": "Yes! We install monitoring on existing solar systems throughout South Hadley regardless of age, brand, or who installed them. Our solutions work with Enphase, SolarEdge, SMA, Fronius, Generac, and virtually all other major equipment. We'll assess your system during a free consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does monitoring improve my solar system's performance?",
   "answer": "Monitoring provides data-driven insights into your system's performance, helping us identify optimization opportunities like panel cleaning schedules, tree trimming needs, and consumption timing. South Hadley clients following our recommendations typically see 12-18% production increases in the first year."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will I get notified if there's a problem?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! You'll receive instant alerts via email, text, or mobile app when our system detects anomalies, performance drops, or equipment failures. Our South Hadley support team also monitors critical alerts and will contact you if immediate action is needed."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I access monitoring data from my phone?",
   "answer": "Yes! Our monitoring includes user-friendly mobile apps for iOS and Android, plus web-based dashboards. Check real-time production, historical data, consumption tracking, and savings calculations from anywhere, anytime."
  },
  {
   "question": "Does monitoring help during Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Definitely! Winter monitoring is particularly valuable in South Hadley. Our system distinguishes between normal snow-related production decreases and actual equipment failures. You'll know when snow removal is worthwhile and can track your system's recovery after storms."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does solar monitoring cost in South Hadley?",
   "answer": "Residential monitoring starts at $29/month for basic tracking, $49/month for advanced analytics with optimization recommendations. One-time setup is $299 including hardware and installation. This investment typically pays for itself through increased efficiency and early problem detection. Annual plans get one month free."
