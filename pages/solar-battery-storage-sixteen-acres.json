 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What does solar battery storage cost in Sixteen Acres, MA?",
   "answer": "Solar battery storage installation in Sixteen Acres typically costs $12,000-$25,000 depending on capacity and configuration. Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) installations average $14,000-$16,000 including all equipment, labor, permits, and activation.

  },
  {
   "question": "How long will a battery power my Sixteen Acres home during an outage?",
   "answer": "Battery backup duration depends on your Sixteen Acres home's energy consumption and battery capacity. A single Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits (refrigerator, lights, WiFi, critical outlets) for 24+ hours, or whole-home for 8-12 hours depending on usage. With solar panels, the battery recharges daily for indefinite backup. For complete whole-home backup, most Sixteen Acres homes need 2-3 Powerwalls. We'll design the right system for your family's needs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add battery storage to my existing Sixteen Acres solar panels?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We specialize in retrofitting battery storage to existing solar installations throughout Sixteen Acres and the Greater Springfield area. Modern batteries like Tesla Powerwall integrate seamlessly with virtually all solar panel brands and inverter types, regardless of system age. We'll assess your current Sixteen Acres solar setup and design the optimal battery integration to maximize your existing solar investment."
  },

   "answer": "Sixteen Acres residents qualify for significant battery storage benefits. The Federal Solar Investment financing applies when batteries are paired with solar panels, saving $3,640+ on typical installations. Massachusetts SMART program provides solar benefits, and National Grid's Connected Solutions program pays annually for battery participation. Combined benefits can reduce your total cost by 30-45%. We handle all incentive paperwork for your Sixteen Acres installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Which battery is best for Sixteen Acres homes: Tesla Powerwall or alternatives?",
   "answer": "Tesla Powerwall is our most popular choice in Sixteen Acres due to proven reliability, 13.5 kWh capacity, excellent 10-year warranty, and smart features. We also install LG Chem RESU (great value), Enphase IQ Battery (ideal for Enphase microinverter systems), and Generac PWRcell (highest capacity option). The best battery for your Sixteen Acres home depends on your solar equipment, energy usage, backup needs, and budget. We'll recommend the perfect solution during your consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will battery storage save money on my Sixteen Acres electric bills?",
   "answer": "Yes! Sixteen Acres residents served by National Grid can save significantly with battery storage. By using stored solar energy during expensive peak evening hours, you avoid high time-of-use rates. Typical Sixteen Acres homeowners save $80-$150 monthly on electricity bills with optimized battery storage. Over the 10+ year battery lifespan, total savings often reach $15,000-$30,000. We'll analyze your National Grid bills and calculate specific savings for your Sixteen Acres home."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does battery installation take in Sixteen Acres?",
   "answer": "Physical battery installation at your Sixteen Acres home takes 1-2 days. The complete process from consultation to activated system typically takes 4-8 weeks, including system design, Springfield building permits, National Grid utility approval, equipment procurement, installation, and final inspection. We manage every step and keep you updated throughout. Most Sixteen Acres customers are impressed by how smooth and hassle-free the process is."
