    {
      "question": "How much space do I need for ground-mount solar in Granville?",
      "answer": "Most residential ground-mount systems (6-12 kW) in Granville require 600-2,400 square feet of land. For hillside properties, we can work with sloped terrain. Our Granville team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your property's specific terrain and conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is ground-mount solar suitable for Granville's hilltown weather?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are specifically engineered for western Massachusetts hilltown weather. They're designed to handle heavy snow loads common in Granville and Hampden County hilltowns. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing much easier than rooftop systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost for ground-mount solar in Granville?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Granville typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Granville homeowners see payback within 7-10 years with 25+ years of savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Granville?",
      "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations in Granville require building permits and must comply with local zoning including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Granville and Hampden County authorities, ensuring your system meets all Massachusetts codes and regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Granville?",
      "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Granville typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility is much greater than rooftop systems, ideal for growing Granville families and farms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Granville customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of heavy snow or leaves."
