 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should Monson homeowners have their solar panels maintained?",
   "answer": "We recommend annual professional maintenance as a minimum for Monson solar systems. Properties with significant tree coverage should consider biannual service - spring cleaning to remove pollen and winter debris, and fall maintenance to prepare for winter. Regular maintenance can increase energy production by 15-30% compared to neglected systems, quickly paying for itself through improved energy savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs my solar panels need professional service?",
   "answer": "Warning signs include: noticeable decrease in energy production, error messages or warning lights on your inverter, visible dirt or debris buildup on panels, physical damage like cracks or loose connections, water intrusion in electrical boxes, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Monson solar installation, contact us promptly for inspection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional cleaning better than hosing off panels myself?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! While a garden hose can rinse loose dust, professional cleaning is far more effective and safer. We use specialized equipment, proper safety gear for rooftop work, and professional-grade solutions that remove stubborn contaminants without damaging panels. DIY cleaning risks personal injury, panel damage that could void warranties, and often leaves residue that continues reducing efficiency."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you provide emergency solar repair services in Monson?",
   "answer": "Yes! We offer 24/7 emergency solar repair for critical issues like complete system failure, electrical hazards, inverter problems, or storm damage. Our Monson-area emergency response typically arrives within 4-6 hours, equipped with common parts and diagnostic tools to resolve most issues on the first visit, minimizing your solar downtime."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you service solar systems installed by other companies?",
   "answer": "Definitely! We maintain and repair all brands and types of solar installations throughout Monson, regardless of who performed the original installation. Our technicians are trained on all major solar equipment manufacturers and provide warranty-compliant service. We treat every Monson solar system with the same expertise and care."
  },
  {
   "question": "What does your annual maintenance package include?",
   "answer": "Our Monson annual maintenance package includes: two comprehensive service visits (typically spring and fall), thorough professional cleaning, complete system inspection, inverter diagnostics, electrical testing, performance analysis with before/after data, priority scheduling for emergency repairs, and 15% discount on any parts or labor needed throughout the year."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much do typical solar repairs cost in Monson?",
   "answer": "Repair costs vary by issue type. Simple repairs like reconnecting wiring or cleaning connections may be $150-300. Inverter component repairs range from $400-1,500. Full inverter replacement typically costs $1,500-3,500 depending on system size. Individual panel replacement runs $300-600 per panel. We always provide detailed estimates before beginning work."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will professional maintenance void my warranty?",
   "answer": "No - professional maintenance protects your warranty. Many solar panel manufacturers require proof of regular professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. We provide detailed documentation of all service performed, ensuring your warranty remains valid. Our maintenance procedures comply with all manufacturer requirements and industry best practices."
