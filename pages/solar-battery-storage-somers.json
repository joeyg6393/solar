 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does Tesla Powerwall cost in Somers, CT?",
   "answer": "Tesla Powerwall installation in Somers costs approximately $14,000-$16,000 for a single 13.5 kWh unit, including all equipment, professional installation, permits, and activation. After applying the competitive pricing, your net investment drops to $10,360-$11,840. Multiple Powerwalls cost less per unit when installed together. We offer detailed quotes, flexible financing, and help you maximize all financing options for your Somers installation."

   "question": "Will a battery backup my entire Somers home during power outages?",
   "answer": "Yes, with appropriate sizing. A single Tesla Powerwall can backup essential circuits in your Somers home (refrigerator, lights, WiFi, outlets) for 24+ hours. For complete whole-home backup, most Somers homes require 2-3 Powerwalls depending on size and energy usage. With solar panels, batteries recharge daily for indefinite backup. We'll design a system that provides the exact backup coverage your Somers family needs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add battery storage to my existing Somers solar panels?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We regularly retrofit battery storage to existing solar installations throughout Somers and Tolland County. Modern batteries like Tesla Powerwall integrate with virtually all solar panel brands and inverter types, regardless of installation age. We'll assess your current Somers solar system and design the optimal battery integration to maximize your existing investment."

   "answer": "Somers residents qualify for substantial battery storage benefits. The Federal Solar Investment financing applies when batteries are installed with solar panels, saving $3,640-$6,500 on typical systems. Connecticut offers state-level benefits through Eversource programs. Combined, these benefits reduce your total investment by 30-40%. Our team handles all incentive applications and ensures you receive every available dollar for your Somers installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long do solar batteries last in Connecticut's climate?",
   "answer": "Quality batteries like Tesla Powerwall are engineered for 10+ years of daily operation and include 10-year warranties. In Somers' climate with cold winters and warm summers, proper installation ensures optimal longevity. Most homeowners experience 12-15 years of excellent performance. Tesla Powerwall maintains 70%+ capacity after 10 years. We install batteries in temperature-controlled locations when possible to maximize lifespan for Somers customers."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will battery storage save money on my Somers electric bills?",
   "answer": "Yes, significantly! Somers residents served by Eversource benefit from battery storage by using stored solar energy during expensive peak evening hours instead of grid power. Typical Somers homeowners save $80-$150 monthly with optimized battery storage. Over the system's lifetime, total savings often reach $15,000-$30,000. We'll analyze your Eversource bills and calculate specific projected savings for your Somers home."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does battery installation take in Somers?",
   "answer": "The physical battery installation at your Somers home typically takes 1-2 days. The complete process from contract to activation averages 4-8 weeks, including engineering design, Somers building permits, Eversource utility approval, equipment delivery, installation, and final inspection. We manage every step seamlessly and keep you informed throughout your Somers battery storage installation."
