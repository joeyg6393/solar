  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What does a residential solar installation cost in Somers, CT?",
      "answer": "Solar panel installation costs in Somers typically range from $15,500-$35,000 before benefits for a complete residential system. After the competitive pricing, your net investment is $11,500-$26,000. System size depends on your home's energy consumption - most Somers homes install 6-10 kW systems. With zero-down financing, your monthly solar payment is often $80-$180 lower than your current Eversource electric bill."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money will I save with solar panels in Somers?",
      "answer": "Somers homeowners save an average of $1,800-$2,400 per year on electricity costs after installing solar panels. Over 25 years, total savings typically exceed $50,000-$65,000 when factoring in Connecticut's high electricity rates and annual utility increases averaging 3-5%. Connecticut's net metering policy amplifies savings by crediting you for all excess energy your system produces."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my Somers home a good candidate for solar panels?",
      "answer": "Most Somers homes are excellent for solar! We can install on asphalt shingle, metal, tile, and flat roofs. Your roof should ideally have 15+ years of remaining lifespan, south to southwest orientation, and minimal shading from trees or structures. During our free consultation, we'll assess your specific property and can recommend ground-mount alternatives if rooftop installation isn't ideal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar panel installation take in Somers?",
      "answer": "The physical installation on your Somers home typically takes 1-3 days for most residential systems. The complete process from signing your contract to system activation averages 6-10 weeks, which includes custom design, Town of Somers permit approval, equipment procurement, installation, inspection, and Eversource interconnection. We manage the entire timeline and keep you updated at every stage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels work well in Connecticut winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar panels are actually more efficient in cold temperatures - they need sunlight, not heat. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed with smooth surfaces that facilitate snow shedding, and the dark panels absorb heat to accelerate melting. We engineer all Somers installations to handle Connecticut's heavy snow loads, ice, and wind, ensuring reliable year-round performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar panels increase my Somers home's resale value?",
      "answer": "Definitely! Research from Zillow shows homes with solar panels sell for 4.1% more on average than comparable homes without solar. For a typical Somers home valued at $300,000, that represents about $12,000 in added value. Additionally, solar homes tend to sell faster than non-solar homes, making it beneficial for current savings and future resale."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties come with my Somers solar installation?",
      "answer": "Your Somers solar system includes comprehensive protection: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels guaranteeing 80-85% efficiency throughout the warranty period, 25-year manufacturer warranty on inverter equipment, 10-year workmanship guarantee covering our installation quality, and a lifetime warranty on roof waterproofing. We also provide production guarantees ensuring your system generates projected energy. All warranties transfer to new homeowners if you sell."
