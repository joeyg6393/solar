 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in Russell?",
   "answer": "A typical residential ground-mount system (6-12 kW) in Russell requires 600-2,400 square feet of land. The exact footprint depends on your energy needs and system capacity. Our Russell team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your property's terrain."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is ground-mount solar suitable for Russell's hilly terrain?",
   "answer": "Yes! Ground-mount systems are actually ideal for Russell's varied terrain. We can position panels on slopes for optimal sun exposure and engineer foundations specifically for hillside installations. This flexibility is a major advantage over rooftop systems in areas with challenging terrain."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the cost for ground-mount solar in Russell?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Russell typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Russell homeowners see payback within 7-10 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Russell?",
   "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations in Russell require building permits and must comply with local zoning including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Russell and Hampden County authorities, ensuring your system meets all Massachusetts codes and regulations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Russell?",
   "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Russell typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and inspections (1-2 weeks)."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility is much greater than rooftop systems, ideal for growing Russell families and farms."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Russell customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow."
