 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should I schedule solar panel maintenance in Agawam?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional maintenance at least once annually for Agawam solar systems. Properties near the Connecticut River or areas with significant tree coverage may benefit from bi-annual service due to higher debris and pollen accumulation. Commercial installations typically need more frequent service—quarterly inspections help ensure consistent high-level performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens during a solar maintenance visit in Agawam?",
   "answer": "Our comprehensive Agawam maintenance visit includes: complete visual inspection of panels and mounting hardware, thermal imaging scan to detect hot spots and defects, inverter diagnostics and testing, electrical connection inspection and tightening, professional panel cleaning, production monitoring review, safety testing, and detailed documentation of system condition with recommendations."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can dirty solar panels really reduce my energy production?",
   "answer": "Yes, significantly. Research shows that accumulated dirt, pollen, bird droppings, and environmental debris can reduce solar panel efficiency by 15-30%. In Agawam, spring pollen and tree debris are particularly problematic. Professional cleaning safely removes these contaminants and typically restores full production capacity, often paying for itself through increased energy generation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency solar repair in Agawam?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency repair services throughout Agawam and surrounding areas. If your system completely fails, displays critical error messages, suffers storm damage, or presents safety concerns, call our emergency line immediately. We prioritize critical situations and typically respond within 4 hours for Agawam customers."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will you service solar panels not installed by your company?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We service all solar installations in Agawam regardless of the original installer. Our NABCEP certified technicians are trained on all major solar panel brands and inverter types. We'll review your system documentation, honor existing warranties, and provide the same expert care we give systems we installed ourselves."
  },
  {
   "question": "What does your Agawam annual maintenance plan include?",
   "answer": "Our Agawam annual plan includes: two comprehensive service visits (spring and fall), complete professional panel cleaning, detailed 32-point system inspection, inverter diagnostics and firmware updates, electrical testing, mounting hardware verification, performance analysis, priority emergency service, 15% discount on repairs, and detailed reports after each visit documenting system health and performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if my Agawam solar system needs repair?",
   "answer": "Common warning signs include: unexpected drops in energy production (15% or more), inverter error messages or warning lights, monitoring system alerts, visible panel damage (cracks, discoloration), higher electric bills, unusual equipment noises, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact us immediately for free diagnostics. Early intervention prevents minor issues from becoming expensive failures."
