 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "Why does Granville's high elevation require specialized solar maintenance?",
   "answer": "As one of Massachusetts' highest towns (1,200-2,300+ feet elevation), Granville experiences harsher winters than most of the state, stronger and more frequent winds, greater snow accumulation, more extreme temperature fluctuations, and accelerated weather-related wear. These factors demand specialized maintenance focusing on mounting reinforcement, cold-weather performance, snow load management, wind resilience, and freeze-thaw electrical integrity. Standard maintenance approaches are inadequate for Granville's extreme conditions."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does Granville's snowfall affect solar panel systems?",
   "answer": "Granville receives significantly more snowfall than lowland Massachusetts communities, averaging 70-90+ inches annually. Heavy snow can physically stress mounting systems, cover panels reducing production for extended periods, cause ice damming at panel edges, and leave residue after melting. Our maintenance includes snow load assessment, mounting reinforcement when needed, spring cleaning to remove winter residue, and optimization strategies for winter energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can solar systems really handle Granville's extreme winter temperatures?",
   "answer": "Yes, when properly maintained. Solar panels actually perform better in cold temperatures, but extreme cold (Granville can reach -20°F to -30°F) affects inverters and electrical connections. Our maintenance specifically addresses cold-weather impacts including inverter cold-start performance, connection integrity after freeze-thaw cycles, and thermal expansion effects. Proper hilltown maintenance ensures reliable winter operation despite extreme temperatures."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if my Granville solar system needs reinforcement?",
   "answer": "Warning signs include loose mounting hardware, visible movement or flexing during wind events, gaps between panels and roof, unusual sounds during high winds, or degraded performance after storms. Our maintenance includes thorough structural assessment of mounting systems. Given Granville's wind exposure and snow loads, many systems benefit from reinforcement, especially if originally installed using lowland specifications."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should Granville solar systems be maintained differently than lowland systems?",
   "answer": "Absolutely. Granville maintenance requires additional focus on weather resilience, more frequent structural inspections, specialized winter preparation, comprehensive spring recovery service, and ongoing snow/ice impact assessment. We recommend semi-annual service for most Granville systems - spring cleaning and inspection after winter, and fall preparation before winter - rather than annual service typical for lowland systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergency repairs in Granville?",
   "answer": "We provide emergency response within 24-48 hours weather and access permitting. Granville's mountain location and weather can affect response times, but we prioritize hilltown emergency calls and maintain mountain-appropriate equipment. Our technicians are experienced with challenging Granville conditions and access routes. We'll always communicate realistic response times based on current conditions."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is spring maintenance especially important for Granville solar systems?",
   "answer": "Extremely important. Granville's harsh winters leave significant impacts including road salt residue (from Route 57 and other roads), accumulated debris, ice damage effects, and connection wear from freeze-thaw cycles. Spring maintenance and cleaning are critical for Granville solar owners to restore peak performance after winter. Most customers see dramatic production increases - often 30-40% - after comprehensive spring service."
  },
  {
   "question": "What makes your team qualified for Granville's challenging conditions?",
   "answer": "We have 15+ years of western Massachusetts hilltown experience including over 250 hilltown solar installations and maintenance contracts. Our technicians are trained in mountain solar system challenges, equipped for challenging access and weather conditions, and experienced with Granville's specific environment. We don't just service solar systems - we specialize in high-elevation solar resilience and performance in Massachusetts' most challenging climate conditions."
