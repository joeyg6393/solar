  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does Granby's tree coverage affect solar panel maintenance needs?",
      "answer": "Granby's beautiful wooded landscape means many solar installations deal with falling leaves, tree sap, and pollen accumulation. These organic materials can significantly reduce panel efficiency if not regularly removed. We recommend at least biannual cleaning - once in late spring after pollen season and again in late fall after leaves have dropped. Systems under heavy tree coverage may benefit from quarterly maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I be concerned about wildlife damaging my solar panels in Granby?",
      "answer": "Yes, wildlife is a consideration in rural Granby. Squirrels, birds, and occasionally larger animals can damage wiring, nest under panels, or cause other issues. During our inspections, we check for signs of wildlife interference and can install protective measures like critter guards. We also assess whether nearby trees provide easy access for animals and recommend trimming if necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Granby's winters affect solar panel performance?",
      "answer": "Winter in Granby brings snow that can temporarily cover panels and ice that may damage mounting systems. However, snow often slides off tilted panels naturally. More concerning is the freeze-thaw cycle that can stress mounting hardware and create small cracks. We recommend fall inspection and maintenance to prepare your system for winter, and spring service to address any winter damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your routine maintenance service?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive Granby solar maintenance includes: thorough panel cleaning, visual inspection of all panels and mounting hardware, inverter diagnostics, electrical connection testing, performance analysis compared to expected output, firmware updates if needed, and a detailed report with photos and recommendations. We also check for wildlife damage and shading issues specific to rural installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to solar emergencies in Granby?",
      "answer": "We offer same-day emergency service for Granby residents when possible, typically responding within 4-6 hours during business hours. For after-hours emergencies involving electrical hazards or storm damage, we aim for response within 8 hours. Most common issues can be resolved on the first visit with our well-stocked service vehicles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is professional solar cleaning worth the cost?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Professional cleaning can restore 15-30% efficiency loss from dirt and debris. For a typical Granby home solar system producing $100-150 in monthly savings, that's $200-400 in recovered annual production - far more than the cost of cleaning. Plus, professional service includes safety equipment and inspection for issues you might miss doing it yourself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you service older solar systems installed years ago?",
      "answer": "Yes! We maintain and repair solar systems of all ages and brands throughout Granby. Older systems often benefit most from professional maintenance, as components may be nearing end of life. We can source replacement parts for discontinued models and recommend cost-effective upgrades when appropriate. Our goal is to extend your system's productive life as long as possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer maintenance contracts for Granby customers?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer annual maintenance contracts that provide excellent value for Granby solar owners. Contracts include scheduled cleaning and inspection visits, priority emergency service, discounted repair rates, and detailed performance tracking. Many customers find the peace of mind and guaranteed savings worth the investment. We can customize a contract to match your system's specific needs."
