  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does Southwick's proximity to Congamond Lakes affect solar panel maintenance?",
      "answer": "Lakeside locations like Southwick experience higher humidity and morning dew that can leave water spots and mineral deposits on solar panels, reducing efficiency. Combined with tree pollen and dust, this creates a film that significantly impacts performance. We recommend at least annual professional cleaning for Southwick systems, with biannual service ideal for properties near the lakes. Professional cleaning can restore 20-30% lost efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are signs my Southwick solar panels need professional service?",
      "answer": "Warning signs include: noticeable decrease in energy production compared to previous months, error messages on your inverter, visible buildup of dirt or pollen on panels, physical damage like cracks, loose mounting hardware, moisture in electrical boxes, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Southwick solar installation, contact us for prompt inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is professional solar cleaning necessary, or can I clean panels myself?",
      "answer": "Professional cleaning is strongly recommended for Southwick solar systems. Lakeside humidity and pollen create stubborn buildup that requires specialized cleaning solutions and equipment. Additionally, rooftop work is dangerous without proper safety equipment. DIY attempts risk personal injury, panel damage that could void warranties, and often leave streaks or residue that continue reducing efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer emergency solar repair in Southwick?",
      "answer": "Yes! We provide 24/7 emergency solar repair service for critical issues including complete system failure, electrical hazards, inverter problems, and storm damage. Our Southwick-area emergency team typically responds within 4 hours during business hours. We arrive fully equipped with common parts and diagnostic tools to resolve most emergencies on the first visit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you service solar panels installed by other companies?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We maintain and repair all brands and types of solar installations throughout Southwick, regardless of who performed the original installation. Our NABCEP certified technicians are trained on all major solar equipment manufacturers and provide warranty-compliant service. Every Southwick solar system receives expert, professional care."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance package?",
      "answer": "Our Southwick annual maintenance package includes: two comprehensive service visits (typically spring and fall), thorough professional cleaning, complete system inspection, inverter diagnostics, electrical safety testing, performance analysis with detailed reports, priority scheduling for emergency repairs, and 15% discount on any parts or labor needed throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do solar repairs typically cost in Southwick?",
      "answer": "Repair costs vary by the specific issue. Simple repairs like cleaning connections or resetting inverters may be $150-300. Component repairs range from $400-1,500. Full inverter replacement typically costs $1,500-3,500 depending on system size. Individual panel replacement runs $300-600 per panel. We always provide detailed estimates before beginning work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will professional maintenance void my solar warranty?",
      "answer": "No - professional maintenance protects your warranty. In fact, many solar panel manufacturers require proof of regular professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. We provide detailed documentation of all service performed that meets manufacturer requirements. Our maintenance procedures comply with all warranty terms and industry best practices, protecting your investment."
