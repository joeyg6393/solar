  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land do I need for ground-mount solar in Blandford?",
      "answer": "Most residential ground-mount systems (8-12 kW) in Blandford require 800-2,400 square feet of land. For hillside installations, we can work with sloped terrain. Our team conducts a comprehensive site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your Blandford property's specific terrain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ground-mount solar handle Blandford's heavy snow?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are specifically engineered for Blandford's mountain weather and heavy snow loads. They're designed to handle the significant snowfall common in western Massachusetts hilltowns. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing easier than rooftop systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical cost for ground-mount solar in Blandford?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Blandford typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. Hillside installations may cost slightly more due to specialized foundations. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Blandford homeowners see payback within 7-10 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are permits required for ground-mount solar in Blandford?",
      "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations require building permits and must comply with Blandford zoning regulations including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Blandford and Hampden County authorities, ensuring your system meets all codes and regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Blandford?",
      "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Blandford typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add panels to my system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth in mind, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility makes ground-mount ideal for growing Blandford families and seasonal properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance is required for ground-mount solar?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level accessibility makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Blandford customers find rain naturally keeps panels clean, with occasional clearing of heavy snow or leaves."
