 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should I have my solar panels maintained in Northampton?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional maintenance at least once per year for Northampton solar systems. Given our regional weather conditions including snow, ice, and pollen seasons, biannual service (spring and fall) is ideal for optimal performance. Regular maintenance ensures your panels stay clean and efficient through all seasons."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs my solar panels need repair?",
   "answer": "Common warning signs include decreased energy production compared to previous months, error messages on your inverter display, visible cracks or damage to panels, loose mounting hardware, water intrusion, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Northampton solar system, contact us immediately for inspection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will cleaning my solar panels really improve performance?",
   "answer": "Yes! Dirt, pollen, bird droppings, and debris can reduce solar panel efficiency by 15-25%. In Northampton, spring pollen and winter residue are particularly problematic. Professional cleaning can restore your panels to near-original efficiency, significantly improving energy production and ROI."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency solar panel repair services?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency repair services for critical solar system failures in Northampton and surrounding areas. If your system has completely shut down or shows signs of electrical hazards, call our emergency line for same-day service. We prioritize safety and rapid restoration of your solar power."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you service solar panels installed by other companies?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our certified technicians are trained to service all major solar panel brands and systems, regardless of who performed the original installation. We work on residential and commercial systems throughout Northampton, providing maintenance and repairs with the same quality standards we apply to our own installations."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance contract?",
   "answer": "Our comprehensive annual maintenance contract for Northampton customers includes two professional cleaning visits, complete system inspections, inverter diagnostics, electrical connection testing, performance monitoring reports, priority scheduling for repairs, and 15% discount on any repair parts or labor needed throughout the year."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does solar panel repair cost in Northampton?",
   "answer": "Repair costs vary depending on the issue. Simple repairs like reconnecting loose wiring may cost $150-300, while inverter replacements can range from $1,500-3,000. Panel replacement costs $300-500 per panel. We always provide detailed estimates before beginning work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties if your system is still within the warranty period."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance void my solar panel warranty?",
   "answer": "Our maintenance services are warranty-compliant and will not void your manufacturer's warranty. In fact, many warranties require proof of regular professional maintenance. We document all service visits and provide detailed records that satisfy warranty requirements, protecting your investment in your Northampton solar system."
