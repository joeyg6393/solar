 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should solar panels be maintained in Brimfield, MA?",
   "answer": "We recommend annual professional maintenance for most Brimfield solar systems. Properties with heavy tree coverage, near agricultural areas, or experiencing significant bird activity may benefit from semi-annual service. Brimfield's rural setting and Massachusetts climate - with spring pollen, summer storms, fall foliage, and winter conditions - make regular professional maintenance essential for sustained peak performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are common solar panel problems in Brimfield?",
   "answer": "Common issues include efficiency loss from accumulated dirt and debris, inverter failures or malfunctions, loose or corroded electrical connections, mounting system deterioration, panel damage from fallen branches or severe weather, and monitoring system errors. Regular maintenance identifies most of these issues early when they're simple and inexpensive to address, preventing costly repairs and production losses."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can dirty panels really impact my energy production?",
   "answer": "Absolutely. Studies show that dirt, pollen, bird droppings, and environmental debris can reduce solar panel efficiency by 15-25% or even more. In Brimfield's rural environment with abundant trees and seasonal pollen, this buildup occurs faster than in urban areas. Professional cleaning typically restores full efficiency and often pays for itself within months through increased energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service all brands of solar equipment?",
   "answer": "Yes, our Brimfield technicians are trained to service all major solar panel brands (SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, REC, Panasonic, etc.) and all inverter types including string inverters (SMA, Fronius, SolarEdge), microinverters (Enphase, APsystems), and hybrid systems. We maintain manufacturer relationships for technical support and genuine replacement parts."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your solar maintenance service?",
   "answer": "Our comprehensive Brimfield maintenance includes professional panel cleaning with purified water, complete electrical system inspection, inverter testing and diagnostics, connection testing and tightening, mounting hardware structural checks, monitoring system verification, performance measurement, thermal imaging when needed, and a detailed service report with photos and recommendations for optimal system care."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does solar panel maintenance cost?",
   "answer": "Basic residential maintenance in Brimfield starts at $175. Annual maintenance contracts providing the best value range from $299-$599 based on system size and service frequency. Most Brimfield homeowners find annual plans cost-effective since professional cleaning alone often increases production enough to offset the service cost, while also preventing expensive repairs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency repair services in Brimfield?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide emergency repair services for urgent situations including storm damage, complete system failures, electrical hazards, and major inverter malfunctions. We understand that every day your Brimfield solar system is down means lost energy production and higher utility bills. Our emergency team typically responds within 24 hours to diagnose problems and begin repairs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance help my solar warranty stay valid?",
   "answer": "Yes, most solar panel and inverter manufacturers require proof of regular professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. We provide detailed documentation for every service visit that satisfies these requirements. Proper maintenance also prevents many issues that would otherwise require warranty service or expensive out-of-pocket repairs, making it essential for protecting your Brimfield solar investment."
