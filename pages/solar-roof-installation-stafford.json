  {
   "question": "How much does a solar roof cost in Stafford, CT?",
   "answer": "Solar roof installation in Stafford typically costs $42,000-$85,000 before benefits, depending on roof size, pitch, and system capacity. With the competitive pricing, you'll immediately save $10,920-$22,100. Connecticut solar benefits provide additional savings. Most Stafford homeowners achieve complete payback in 12-16 years through annual electricity savings of $2,500-$4,500."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does a solar roof perform in Connecticut winters?",
   "answer": "Solar roofs excel in Stafford winters! The dark solar shingles absorb heat, helping snow melt faster than traditional roofing. While production is lower during short winter days, our systems are optimized for year-round Connecticut weather. Solar shingles are engineered to handle heavy snow loads, extreme temperatures, and ice common in Tolland County."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the difference between solar roof and traditional solar panels?",
   "answer": "Solar roofs integrate directly into your roof structure, replacing traditional shingles with energy-generating ones. This creates seamless aesthetics versus bulky panels mounted on top. Solar roofs provide complete roof replacement, often come with better warranties, and add more home value. They're ideal if your Stafford home needs a new roof anyway."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar roof installation take in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Most residential solar roof installations in Stafford are completed in 3-5 days of active work, weather permitting. The full process from contract to activation typically takes 2-3 months, including custom design, permitting with Stafford building department, and utility interconnection with Eversource."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I get financing for a solar roof in Stafford, CT?",
   "answer": "Yes! We offer multiple financing options including $0 down solar loans, home equity financing, and PACE programs for Stafford homeowners. With the competitive pricing and immediate electricity savings, most customers achieve positive cash flow from day one. Monthly loan payments are typically lower than current electric bills."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties come with solar roof installation?",
   "answer": "You receive comprehensive protection: 25-year power production warranty ensuring your system generates as promised, 25-year weatherproofing warranty protecting against leaks and damage, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and full manufacturer warranties on all equipment. We stand behind every Stafford installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will a solar roof increase my Stafford home value?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Studies show solar installations increase home values by $20,000-$40,000 on average in Connecticut. Solar roofs add even more value because they combine a brand-new roof with energy generation. Stafford homes with solar sell faster and command premium prices as energy costs continue rising."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need special permits for solar roof installation in Stafford?",
   "answer": "Yes, solar roof installations require building permits from Stafford building department and electrical permits. We handle all permitting, inspections, and utility interconnection paperwork with Eversource. Our team has extensive experience with Stafford requirements, ensuring smooth and timely approval."
