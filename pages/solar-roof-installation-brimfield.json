    {
      "question": "How much does a solar roof cost in Brimfield, MA?",
      "answer": "Solar roof installation in Brimfield typically costs $42,000-$85,000 before benefits, depending on roof size and system capacity. With the competitive pricing, you'll immediately save $10,920-$22,100. Massachusetts SMART program provides substantial additional benefits. Most Brimfield homeowners achieve complete payback in 10-14 years through annual electricity savings of $2,500-$4,500."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a solar roof perform in Massachusetts winters?",
      "answer": "Solar roofs excel in Brimfield winters! The dark solar shingles absorb heat, helping snow melt faster than traditional roofing. While production is lower during short winter days, our systems are optimized for year-round Massachusetts weather. Solar shingles are engineered to handle heavy snow loads, extreme temperatures, and ice common in Hampden County."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between solar roof and traditional solar panels?",
      "answer": "Solar roofs integrate directly into your roof structure, replacing traditional shingles with energy-generating ones. This creates seamless aesthetics versus bulky panels mounted on top. Solar roofs provide complete roof replacement, often come with better warranties, and add more home value. They're ideal if your Brimfield home needs a new roof anyway."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar roof installation take in Brimfield?",
      "answer": "Most residential solar roof installations in Brimfield are completed in 3-5 days of active work, weather permitting. The full process from contract to activation typically takes 2-3 months, including custom design, permitting with Brimfield building department, and utility interconnection with National Grid."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get financing for a solar roof in Brimfield, MA?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer multiple financing options including $0 down solar loans, home equity financing, and Massachusetts-specific programs for Brimfield homeowners. With the competitive pricing, SMART benefits, and immediate electricity savings, most customers achieve positive cash flow from day one. Monthly loan payments are typically lower than current electric bills."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties come with solar roof installation?",
      "answer": "You receive comprehensive protection: 25-year power production warranty ensuring your system generates as promised, 25-year weatherproofing warranty protecting against leaks and damage, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and full manufacturer warranties on all equipment. We stand behind every Brimfield installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a solar roof increase my Brimfield home value?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Studies show solar installations increase home values by $20,000-$40,000 on average in Massachusetts. Solar roofs add even more value because they combine a brand-new roof with energy generation. Brimfield homes with solar sell faster and command premium prices as energy costs continue rising."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special permits for solar roof installation in Brimfield?",
      "answer": "Yes, solar roof installations require building permits from Brimfield building department and electrical permits. We handle all permitting, inspections, and utility interconnection paperwork with National Grid. Our team has extensive experience with Brimfield requirements, ensuring smooth and timely approval."
