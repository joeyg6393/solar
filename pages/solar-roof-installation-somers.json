  {
   "question": "How much does a solar roof cost in Somers, CT?",
   "answer": "Solar roof installation in Somers typically costs $42,000-$85,000 before benefits, depending on roof size and system capacity. With the competitive pricing, you'll immediately save $10,900-$22,100. Connecticut solar benefits provide additional savings. Most Somers homeowners achieve complete payback in 12-16 years through annual electricity savings of $2,500-$4,500."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does a solar roof perform in Connecticut winters?",
   "answer": "Solar roofs excel in Somers winters! The dark solar shingles absorb heat, helping snow melt faster than traditional roofing. While production is lower during short winter days, our systems are optimized for year-round Connecticut weather. Solar shingles are engineered to handle heavy snow loads, extreme temperatures, and ice common in Tolland County."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the difference between solar roof and traditional solar panels?",
   "answer": "Solar roofs integrate directly into your roof structure, replacing traditional shingles with energy-generating ones. This creates seamless aesthetics versus bulky panels mounted on top. Solar roofs provide complete roof replacement, often come with better warranties, and add more home value. They're ideal if your Somers home needs a new roof anyway."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar roof installation take in Somers?",
   "answer": "Most residential solar roof installations in Somers are completed in 3-5 days of active work, weather permitting. The full process from contract to activation typically takes 2-3 months, including custom design, permitting with Somers building department, and utility interconnection with Eversource."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I get financing for a solar roof in Somers, CT?",
   "answer": "Yes! We offer multiple financing options including $0 down solar loans, home equity financing, and PACE programs for Somers homeowners. With the competitive pricing and immediate electricity savings, most customers achieve positive cash flow from day one. Monthly loan payments are typically lower than current electric bills."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties come with solar roof installation?",
   "answer": "You receive comprehensive protection: 25-year power production warranty ensuring your system generates as promised, 25-year weatherproofing warranty protecting against leaks and damage, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and full manufacturer warranties on all equipment. We stand behind every Somers installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will a solar roof increase my Somers home value?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Studies show solar installations increase home values by $20,000-$40,000 on average in Connecticut. Solar roofs add even more value because they combine a brand-new roof with energy generation. Somers homes with solar sell faster and command premium prices as energy costs rise."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need special permits for solar roof installation in Somers?",
   "answer": "Yes, solar roof installations require building permits from Somers building department and electrical permits. We handle all permitting, inspections, and utility interconnection paperwork with Eversource. Our team has extensive experience with Somers requirements, ensuring smooth and timely approval."
