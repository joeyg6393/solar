  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How often should I clean my solar panels in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Westfield's environment typically requires 2-3 professional cleanings annually. We recommend spring cleaning (after heavy pollen season), mid-summer (after agricultural dust accumulation), and fall (before winter). Properties near wooded areas or agricultural operations may benefit from quarterly cleaning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Westfield's pollen really affect solar panel efficiency that much?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Westfield's surrounding forests produce heavy pollen loads in spring, creating a sticky film that reduces efficiency by 20-30%. Unlike regular dust, pollen adheres strongly to panel surfaces and attracts additional dirt. Professional cleaning removes this buildup that rain simply can't wash away."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I damage my panels by cleaning them myself in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Yes, several ways: using tap water leaves mineral deposits from Westfield's water supply, pressure washing can crack panels or force water into electrical components, abrasive materials scratch surfaces, and harsh chemicals void warranties. Our purified water system and soft-bristle method eliminates these risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do agricultural operations near Westfield affect my solar panels?",
      "answer": "Agricultural areas around Westfield generate fine dust particles during planting, harvesting, and tilling seasons. This dust settles on panels creating a hazy film that blocks sunlight. Combined with morning dew, it creates a cement-like coating that requires professional cleaning to remove without damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the return on investment for professional cleaning in Westfield?",
      "answer": "Excellent! A typical Westfield residential system loses $200-$450 annually from dirty panels. Our cleaning service costs $155-$285 and typically restores 20-25% efficiency immediately. Most clients see full ROI within 2-4 months through increased production, plus extended panel lifespan worth thousands."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you clean solar panels on Westfield farms and agricultural buildings?",
      "answer": "Yes! We have extensive experience with agricultural solar installations in Westfield. Farm buildings often have larger arrays exposed to heavier dust loads requiring specialized cleaning. We offer commercial rates and can schedule cleanings around your agricultural operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can wildlife damage my solar panels in Westfield?",
      "answer": "It's possible. Westfield's wooded areas mean birds, squirrels, and occasionally raccoons interact with roof-mounted panels. Bird droppings are acidic and reduce efficiency. We identify wildlife issues during cleaning and can install deterrents to prevent nesting under panels or damage to wiring."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer group rates for Westfield neighborhoods?",
      "answer": "Yes! When multiple Westfield homeowners schedule together, we offer neighborhood group discounts. This is popular in Westfield's newer developments where many homes have solar. We also provide referral bonuses and discounts for veterans, seniors, and maintenance plan members."
