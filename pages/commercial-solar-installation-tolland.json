  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What are typical energy savings for Tolland businesses with commercial solar?",
      "answer": "Tolland businesses typically save 65-75% on electricity costs with commercial solar. Depending on system size and usage, annual savings range from $15,000 to $50,000+. A 100kW system can save approximately $22,000-$32,000 per year, with total 25-year savings exceeding $650,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I determine the right solar system size for my Tolland business?",
      "answer": "We analyze your utility bills from the past 12-24 months to understand consumption patterns, then evaluate your facility to determine optimal capacity. Factors include energy usage, budget, available roof or ground space, and business goals. Systems range from 20kW to 500kW+ based on needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the installation timeline for commercial solar in Tolland?",
      "answer": "Most Tolland commercial projects take 6-12 weeks from contract to system activation. This includes design/engineering (1-2 weeks), permitting with Tolland and Connecticut (2-4 weeks), installation (2-4 weeks based on size), and inspections/utility approval (1-2 weeks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar installation disrupt my Tolland business operations?",
      "answer": "We design installation to minimize disruption. Most work occurs on rooftops or exterior areas without affecting daily operations. Brief electrical work requires power interruptions (typically 2-4 hours) which we schedule during off-peak times or weekends based on your preference."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do solar panels perform during Connecticut winters?",
      "answer": "Solar panels operate efficiently in cold weather and continue generating power throughout Connecticut winters. While shorter days and occasional snow coverage temporarily reduce output, annual production consistently meets projections. Panels are engineered for New England snow loads and conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What commercial solar financing options are available?",
      "answer": "We work with multiple commercial solar financing partners offering term loans, capital leases, operating leases, and PPAs. Many Tolland businesses prefer ownership through cash purchase or loans to maximize savings. Most financing options provide immediate positive cash flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my solar system needs repairs or service?",
      "answer": "Our systems include comprehensive warranties: 25-year panel performance, 10-year workmanship, and 12-25 year inverter warranties. We offer maintenance agreements for Tolland businesses including monitoring, inspections, and priority service. Most commercial systems require minimal maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add more solar panels in the future?",
      "answer": "Yes, we can design systems with expansion in mind. If you anticipate business growth or increased energy needs, we'll ensure your electrical infrastructure and available space can accommodate future additions. Many Tolland businesses expand their systems as needs grow."
