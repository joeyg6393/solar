  "serviceDescription": "Granby's rural character and open landscapes make it perfect for ground-mount solar installations. Our specialized team has been helping Granby homeowners and property owners achieve energy independence through strategically designed ground-mounted solar systems for over a decade. Whether you own a rural home, small farm, or large property in Granby, ground-mount solar offers the flexibility and performance to meet your energy goals. Ground-mount systems are particularly popular in Granby due to the town's rural nature, larger property sizes, and mix of older homes that may not be ideal for rooftop installations. Unlike rooftop systems limited by roof orientation, pitch, and condition, ground-mount arrays can be positioned optimally regardless of your home's orientation, typically producing 15-25% more energy than comparable rooftop systems. Our Granby ground-mount installations are designed to withstand Western Massachusetts weather conditions including heavy snow loads, ice storms, and high winds. We have extensive experience working with Granby's varied terrain, from level valley areas to hillside properties, ensuring each system is engineered for optimal performance and longevity. We handle every aspect of your project including site surveys to assess sun exposure and soil conditions, engineering and permitting with the Town of Granby, professional installation using premium materials, and long-term maintenance support. Our team works closely with Granby property owners to design systems that complement the natural beauty of their land while maximizing solar energy production. With flexible benefits reducing costs by , Massachusetts SMART program benefits, and net metering benefits from your utility, Granby residents typically achieve payback in 6-9 years followed by decades of free, clean electricity. Ground-mount systems also add property value without the roof penetrations or structural concerns of rooftop installations.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land do I need for ground-mount solar on my Granby property?",
      "answer": "For a typical residential system (8-10 kW), you'll need approximately 800-2000 square feet of relatively flat, unshaded land. Granby's rural properties typically have ample space for ground-mount installations. We can evaluate your property during a free site assessment to determine the best location and system size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems more expensive than rooftop installations?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems typically cost 10-15% more initially due to additional racking and foundation requirements. However, they often produce 15-25% more energy due to optimal positioning, which can result in better long-term value. For Granby properties with roof challenges, ground-mount systems may be more cost-effective overall."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits do I need for ground-mount solar in Granby?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar installations in Granby require building permits and electrical permits from the Town. Depending on your property's zoning and the system size, you may also need approval from the Granby Planning Board. We handle all permitting and ensure compliance with local requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add more solar panels to my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes, one of the advantages of ground-mount systems is expandability. We can design your initial installation with future expansion in mind, making it straightforward to add capacity as your energy needs grow or budget allows. This is popular with Granby homeowners planning to add electric vehicles or heat pumps."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do ground-mount systems perform during Western Massachusetts winters?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems excel in winter conditions. They can be installed at steep angles that naturally shed snow, and the ground-level access makes manual snow clearing easy when needed. Our systems are engineered specifically for the heavy snow loads and ice common in Granby and Western Massachusetts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will ground-mount solar increase my Granby property value?",
      "answer": "Yes, studies consistently show that solar installations increase property values by 3-4% on average. Ground-mount systems provide all the value benefits of solar without affecting your roof condition or warranty. In Granby's market, solar systems are increasingly viewed as valuable property improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ground-mount solar coexist with gardens or lawns?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Many Granby homeowners maintain attractive landscaping around their ground-mount systems. The panels provide partial shade that can benefit certain plants, and pollinator-friendly native plants can be incorporated. Some property owners even use the space for small-scale gardening or chicken runs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does ground-mount solar installation take in Granby?",
      "answer": "The physical installation typically takes 2-4 days for residential systems. The complete timeline from contract signing to system activation is usually 4-8 weeks, including engineering, permitting with the Town of Granby, installation, and utility interconnection. We coordinate all steps and keep you informed throughout."
