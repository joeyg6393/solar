 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How do Amherst's winters affect solar panel performance?",
   "answer": "Amherst's snowy winters can temporarily reduce solar output when panels are covered, but cold temperatures actually improve solar efficiency. However, ice accumulation, snow weight on mounting systems, and freeze-thaw cycles can cause damage. We recommend fall maintenance to prepare your system and spring inspection to address any winter damage to your Amherst solar installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I clean my solar panels myself or hire professionals?",
   "answer": "While homeowners can rinse panels with a hose, professional cleaning is safer and more effective. Our Amherst team uses specialized equipment, proper safety gear for rooftop work, and professional-grade cleaning solutions that remove stubborn buildup without damaging panels. DIY cleaning risks personal injury and potential panel damage that could void warranties."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the best time of year for solar maintenance in Amherst?",
   "answer": "We recommend biannual maintenance for Amherst systems - once in spring (April-May) after winter to remove pollen and check for damage, and once in fall (September-October) to prepare for winter. Spring cleaning is especially important in Amherst due to heavy pollen from our abundant trees. These seasonal services keep your system operating at peak efficiency year-round."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service solar systems at UMass and other colleges?",
   "answer": "Yes! We have extensive experience maintaining commercial and institutional solar installations throughout the Five College area. Our team is equipped to handle large-scale systems and works efficiently to minimize disruption to campus operations. We're familiar with the procurement processes for educational institutions in Amherst."
  },
  {
   "question": "How quickly can you respond to solar emergencies in Amherst?",
   "answer": "For critical solar system failures in Amherst, we offer same-day emergency service with typical response times of 2-4 hours during business hours. After-hours emergencies are addressed within 6-8 hours. We prioritize safety issues like sparking equipment or damaged panels that could pose electrical or fire hazards."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will regular maintenance really save me money?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Regular maintenance can increase your solar system's energy production by 15-30% through proper cleaning and optimization. It also prevents minor issues from becoming expensive repairs. For an average Amherst home, this translates to $200-400 in additional energy savings annually, far exceeding the cost of routine maintenance."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you help with solar monitoring system issues?",
   "answer": "Yes, we troubleshoot and repair solar monitoring systems including Wi-Fi connectivity issues, sensor failures, and software problems. Many Amherst homeowners don't realize their system isn't reporting properly until production drops significantly. We can restore monitoring functionality and set up alerts to notify you of performance issues immediately."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if my solar panels were installed by another company?",
   "answer": "No problem! We service all brands and types of solar installations throughout Amherst, regardless of the original installer. Our technicians are certified to work on major solar brands and can provide maintenance and repairs that comply with manufacturer warranties. We treat every system with the same care and expertise."
