    {
      "question": "What solar financing options and financing options are available in Hadley, MA?",
      "answer": "Hadley residents and businesses can access the federal solar incentive, Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production benefits), net metering trading opportunities, and net metering benefits. Agricultural operations may also qualify for USDA REAP grants covering 25-50% of installation costs. We'll identify all programs you qualify for and help maximize your benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I save with solar in Hadley?",
      "answer": "Savings vary based on system size, energy usage, and financing method. A typical Hadley residential system saves $30,000-$60,000 over 25 years after accounting for all benefits and utility savings. With current benefits, payback periods typically range from 7-10 years. Agricultural operations can see even greater returns. We'll provide exact projections for your property during the consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Hadley farmers get special financing for solar?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We specialize in agricultural solar financing for Hadley's farming community. Options include USDA REAP grants (covering 25-50% of costs), special agricultural solar loans, solar leasing arrangements, and commercial financing programs. Many farms qualify for enhanced SMART program rates. We'll explore all agricultural programs during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is zero-down solar financing available in Hadley?",
      "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple lenders offering $0-down solar loans for qualified Hadley homeowners. Many clients find their monthly loan payment is lower than their previous electric bill, creating immediate savings. Interest rates typically range from 2.99%-6.99% depending on credit and loan term. We'll compare multiple zero-down options during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's better for Hadley homeowners - buying or leasing solar?",
      "answer": "For most Hadley homeowners, purchasing (via cash or loan) provides the best long-term value - you receive all benefits, benefits, and maximize savings. Buying typically yields 20-30% more savings over 25 years compared to leasing. However, leasing can work for those who prefer predictable monthly costs with no maintenance responsibility. We'll compare both options with specific numbers for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Massachusetts SMART program work for Hadley?",
      "answer": "The SMART program pays you a fixed rate for every kilowatt-hour your system produces over 10-20 years. Hadley falls under favorable rate tiers, and payments are made monthly via your utility bill. A typical 8kW residential system can earn $400-$700 annually through SMART. Agricultural systems often qualify for enhanced rates. We handle the entire enrollment process for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will going solar increase my property costs in Hadley?",
      "answer": "No! Massachusetts law provides a 100% increased property value for 20 years. This means while solar typically increases your home's value by 4-6%, your Hadley property costs won't increase due to the solar addition. This is one of many Massachusetts solar benefits we'll explain during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started with solar financing consultation in Hadley?",
      "answer": "Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or request a consultation online. We'll schedule a free meeting at your Hadley home, farm, or business at your convenience. Bring recent utility bills if possible. Within 3-5 business days, you'll receive a comprehensive financial analysis showing your solar potential, all financing options, and multiple financing options with clear comparisons."
