  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much can I save with solar in Agawam, MA?",
      "answer": "Agawam homeowners typically save $1,200-$2,000 annually on electricity bills with solar panels. Over 25 years, that's $30,000-$50,000 in total savings. Factor in the competitive pricing ($3,900-$9,100 immediate reduction), Massachusetts SMART program payments ($20,000-$30,000 over 10 years), and annual net metering income ($1,400-$2,400), and the financial benefits are substantial. Your exact savings depend on system size, energy usage, and financing method."
    },
    {
      "question": "What solar financing is available in Agawam?",
      "answer": "Agawam residents can choose from multiple options: (1) Solar Loans - own your system with zero-down financing, qualify for all benefits, monthly payments often lower than electric bills; (2) Solar Leases - fixed monthly payments with no upfront costs; (3) PPAs - pay only for electricity produced at discounted rates; (4) Cash Purchase - upfront payment for fastest ROI. We'll compare all options during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar with no money down in Agawam?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Zero-down solar financing is widely available in Agawam through solar loans, leases, and PPAs. Zero-down solar loans are especially popular because you own the system immediately, qualify for the competitive pricing and all financing options, and monthly payments are typically lower than current electricity costs. We work with multiple lenders offering competitive rates for Agawam customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar increase my property costs in Agawam?",
      "answer": "No! Massachusetts law provides a 100% property assessment exemption for solar systems for 20 years. While solar increases your Agawam home's value by 3-4% ($15,000-$25,000 typically), you won't pay additional property costs. This exemption is automatic throughout Agawam and Massachusetts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the payback period for solar in Agawam?",
      "answer": "The typical payback period in Agawam is 6-9 years, accounting for the competitive pricing, SMART program payments, net metering income, and electricity savings. Many homeowners achieve even faster payback with rising utility rates. After payback, solar panels continue producing free electricity for 15-20+ years, representing $30,000-$60,000 in additional lifetime savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Massachusetts SMART program work?",
      "answer": "The SMART program pays Agawam solar owners for every kWh produced for 10 years. Rates typically range from $0.25-$0.35/kWh depending on system size. A 7kW residential system in Agawam produces about 8,000-8,500 kWh annually, earning $2,000-$2,975 per year, or $20,000-$29,750 total over the 10-year program period."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are net meterings worth in Massachusetts?",
      "answer": "net metering represent 1,000 kWh of solar production. You earn one net metering per MWh produced, sellable on the Massachusetts market at historically $200-$300. A 7kW system in Agawam produces 7-8 net metering annually, generating $1,400-$2,400 in additional yearly income for 10-15 years, accelerating your solar payback."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does net metering work in Agawam?",
      "answer": "Net metering credits you at full retail rates for excess solar electricity sent to the grid. Credits accumulate month-to-month and offset electricity purchased during nighttime or cloudy periods. With proper system sizing, many Agawam homeowners reduce annual electricity costs to just the monthly connection fee, saving thousands per year."
