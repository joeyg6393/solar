    {
      "question": "How much does solar installation cost in Russell, MA?",
      "answer": "Solar installation in Russell typically costs $17,000-$40,000 before benefits.

      "answer": "Russell solar owners earn Solar Renewable Energy Credits (net metering) for every 1,000 kWh produced. Over 10 years, Russell homeowners typically earn $2,700-$4,800 selling these credits in Massachusetts' net metering market. This income is in addition to electric bill savings. We handle all net metering enrollment and tracking for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are total savings with solar in Russell?",
      "answer": "Russell homeowners save $2,000-$2,800 annually on electricity. Combined with $2,700-$4,800 in net metering income over 10 years, total savings over 25-30 years typically exceed $70,000-$90,000. Massachusetts' net metering provides full retail credits for excess energy, maximizing your financial benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my Russell home suitable for solar?",
      "answer": "Most Russell homes are excellent for solar! We install on various roof types and offer ground-mount systems perfect for Russell's rural properties. During your free consultation, we'll evaluate your specific property including roof condition, orientation, shading, and recommend the optimal solar solution for maximum production."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar installation take in Russell?",

We manage everything and keep you informed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels work in Massachusetts winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar panels are highly efficient in cold weather. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed to shed snow quickly, and cold temperatures improve efficiency. We engineer all Russell installations to handle heavy Massachusetts snow loads, ice, and wind for reliable year-round performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties protect my Russell solar installation?",
      "answer": "Your Russell solar system includes comprehensive coverage: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels, 25-year inverter warranty, 10-year workmanship guarantee, and lifetime roof waterproofing warranty. We also guarantee projected energy production and net metering generation. All warranties transfer if you sell your Russell home."
