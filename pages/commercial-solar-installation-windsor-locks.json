    "Frequently Asked Questions About Commercial Solar in Windsor Locks"
  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much can my Windsor Locks business save with commercial solar?",
      "answer": "Most Windsor Locks businesses reduce their electricity costs by 60-70% immediately after installation. With Connecticut's high commercial electricity rates (averaging $0.18-$0.24/kWh), a typical 100kW commercial system can save $15,000-$25,000 annually. Over 25 years, total savings often exceed $500,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size commercial solar system does my Windsor Locks business need?",
      "answer": "System size depends on your energy consumption, available roof/ground space, and budget. A small retail shop might need 20-30kW, while manufacturing facilities often require 200-500kW or more. We analyze your utility bills and facility to recommend the optimal size for maximum ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does commercial solar installation take in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "After contract signing, the process typically takes 4-12 weeks total. This includes engineering and design (1-2 weeks), permitting in Windsor Locks (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks), and utility approval (1-2 weeks). Larger systems may take longer, but we work efficiently to minimize timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar installation disrupt my Windsor Locks business operations?",
      "answer": "We design our installation process to minimize disruption. Most roof work doesn't impact interior operations. Electrical work requires brief shutdowns (typically a few hours), which we schedule during off-hours or low-activity periods. Many businesses continue normal operations throughout installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my commercial solar system during Connecticut winters?",
      "answer": "Solar panels actually perform better in cold temperatures and continue generating power even in winter. While shorter days and snow coverage can reduce production temporarily, annual output meets projections. Modern panels are engineered to withstand Connecticut snow loads, and snow typically slides off quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my commercial solar system?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Battery storage is becoming increasingly popular for Windsor Locks businesses wanting backup power during outages or to maximize savings through demand charge reduction. We can integrate battery systems during initial installation or add them later to existing solar arrays."
    },
    {
      "question": "What commercial solar financing options are available in Connecticut?",
      "answer": "Windsor Locks businesses benefit from the federal solar benefits, 5-year MACRS accelerated depreciation (worth ~20% of system cost), and potential Connecticut ZREC or LREC programs. Combined, these benefits can reduce your net investment by 40-50%."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle all permitting and utility approvals for Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "Yes, we manage the entire permitting process including Windsor Locks building permits, Connecticut electrical permits, and interconnection agreements with Eversource or your utility provider. Our experience with local jurisdictions ensures smooth approvals and faster project completion."
