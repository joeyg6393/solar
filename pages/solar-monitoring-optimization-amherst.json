  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do I need solar monitoring if my system is working?",
      "answer": "Many Amherst solar owners lose 10-20% of potential production without realizing it. Monitoring catches issues like shading problems, panel degradation, inverter inefficiencies, and connection problems before they significantly impact your savings. It also helps optimize your energy usage patterns to maximize self-consumption and net metering benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can monitoring detect problems before my solar system fails completely?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our predictive monitoring identifies early warning signs like gradual production declines, inverter errors, or individual panel underperformance. This allows for proactive maintenance that prevents complete failures and extends system lifespan. Amherst clients save thousands in avoided emergency repairs through early detection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does monitoring work during Amherst's snowy winters?",
      "answer": "Our monitoring system accounts for seasonal variations and weather conditions specific to western Massachusetts. During winter, we adjust expected production baselines for shorter days and potential snow coverage. You'll receive alerts if production doesn't resume normally after snow events, indicating possible issues requiring attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the monitoring platform difficult to use?",
      "answer": "Not at all! Our platform is designed for ease of use with intuitive dashboards that show your key metrics at a glance. Most Amherst homeowners check their app once a week to see production and savings. We provide complete training, and our support team is always available if you have questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can monitoring help me go off-grid or prepare for power outages?",
      "answer": "Yes! When combined with battery storage, our monitoring platform helps you optimize energy independence. For Amherst properties, we can configure your system to maximize battery charging during peak production and use stored energy during grid outages or expensive peak rate periods, significantly reducing your utility bills."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my internet goes down?",
      "answer": "Our monitoring equipment includes local data storage and cellular backup communication options. Even without internet, your system continues collecting data. Once connectivity is restored, all historical data syncs automatically. Critical alerts can be sent via cellular connection to ensure you're notified of any issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does monitoring increase my Amherst home's resale value?",
      "answer": "Documented solar performance history significantly boosts buyer confidence and justifies premium pricing. Our monitoring platform generates professional performance reports showing actual energy production, savings achieved, and system reliability—powerful tools when selling your Amherst home. Studies show homes with documented solar performance sell faster and for 3-4% more."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I monitor multiple properties from one account?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our platform supports multi-site monitoring, perfect for Amherst property owners with rental properties, vacation homes, or commercial buildings. View all your systems from one dashboard and compare performance across properties to identify optimization opportunities."
