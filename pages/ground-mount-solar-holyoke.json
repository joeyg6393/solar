  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land is needed for ground-mount solar in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "For typical Holyoke residential installations, you'll need approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet of relatively flat, unshaded land for a 10kW system. This is about the size of a large backyard. Commercial systems require more space depending on energy needs. Our free site assessment will determine the optimal system size for your specific Holyoke property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems good for former industrial properties in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Holyoke's former industrial properties are excellent candidates for ground-mount solar. These sites often have available land unsuitable for building but perfect for solar. Ground-mount installations can help redevelop brownfield sites while generating clean energy and income through the SMART program."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required in Holyoke for ground-mount solar?",
      "answer": "Holyoke ground-mount installations require building permits from the City of Holyoke Building Department and electrical permits. Depending on system size and location, zoning approval may be needed. We handle all permitting and ensure compliance with Holyoke's local regulations as part of our turnkey installation service."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do ground-mount systems handle Holyoke's winter weather?",
      "answer": "Our ground-mount systems are specifically engineered for New England weather, including Holyoke's snow, ice, and wind conditions. The elevated mounting allows snow to slide off naturally, and ground-level access makes snow removal easy when needed. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations in winter months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical timeline for a Holyoke ground-mount installation?",
      "answer": "After permit approval, most Holyoke residential ground-mount systems are installed in 3-5 days. The permitting process typically takes 4-8 weeks depending on system complexity. Commercial projects may take longer. We provide a detailed timeline during consultation and keep you informed throughout the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options are available in Holyoke?",
      "answer": "Holyoke residents and businesses qualify for the competitive pricing, Massachusetts SMART program (providing 10-20 years of production incentive payments), and solar renewable energy certificates (net metering). Combined, these benefits can reduce your net system cost by 40-60%. We help you maximize all available Holyoke benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system as my needs grow?",
      "answer": "Yes! One of the biggest advantages of ground-mount solar is expandability. We can design your initial Holyoke installation to accommodate future expansion, making it easy to add panels as your budget allows or energy needs increase. This flexibility is perfect for growing Holyoke families and businesses."
