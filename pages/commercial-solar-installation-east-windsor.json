 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much can my East Windsor business save with commercial solar?",
   "answer": "East Windsor businesses typically save $20,000-$35,000 annually depending on system size and energy usage. A 100kW commercial system can reduce electricity costs by 65-70%, with total savings over 25 years often exceeding $700,000. Savings start immediately upon system activation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What size commercial solar system does my East Windsor facility need?",
   "answer": "System sizing depends on your energy consumption, available space, and budget. Small businesses might need 20-40kW, while larger facilities often require 100-500kW or more. We analyze your utility bills and site to recommend the optimal size for maximum ROI."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does commercial solar installation take in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "Most East Windsor commercial projects complete in 6-10 weeks total. Timeline includes design and engineering (1-2 weeks), permitting (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks), and inspections/activation (1-2 weeks). Larger systems may require additional time."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will installation disrupt my East Windsor business operations?",
   "answer": "We design our process to minimize disruption. Most installation work occurs on rooftops or exterior areas without affecting interior operations. Brief electrical shutdowns (2-4 hours) are scheduled at convenient times. Many businesses operate normally throughout installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to solar panels during Connecticut snow and ice?",
   "answer": "Our commercial solar panels are engineered for Connecticut weather including heavy snow loads. Panels continue generating power in cold weather, and snow typically slides off due to panel angle and heat. Annual production accounts for seasonal variations and consistently meets projections."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add battery storage to my commercial solar system?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Battery storage is increasingly popular for East Windsor businesses seeking backup power during outages or peak demand reduction. We can integrate batteries during initial installation or retrofit them to existing systems for enhanced energy management."
  },
  {
   "question": "What commercial solar financing is available?",
   "answer": "We work with multiple commercial financing partners offering loans, capital leases, operating leases, and PPAs. Many East Windsor businesses prefer ownership through loans or cash purchase to maximize tax benefits. Financing often provides immediate positive cash flow."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if my East Windsor building can support solar panels?",
   "answer": "Most commercial buildings are suitable for solar. During our free assessment, we evaluate roof age, condition, structural capacity, and orientation. Even if your roof isn't ideal, we can explore alternatives like ground-mount systems or carport installations."
