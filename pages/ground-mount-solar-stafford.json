  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land is required for ground-mount solar in Stafford?",
      "answer": "A typical residential ground-mount system (8-12 kW) in Stafford needs approximately 800-2,400 square feet of land. The exact requirement depends on your energy needs and system size. Our Stafford team conducts a comprehensive property assessment to determine the optimal layout for your specific site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems suitable for Stafford's winter weather?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are engineered specifically for Connecticut winters and northeastern weather patterns. They're designed to handle snow loads common in Stafford and Tolland County. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes any needed clearing much easier than rooftop systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost for ground-mount solar in Stafford?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Stafford typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing, Connecticut programs, and potential USDA grants, net investment is substantially lower. Most Stafford property owners see payback within 7-10 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Stafford?",
      "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations in Stafford require building permits and must comply with local zoning regulations including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Stafford and Tolland County authorities, ensuring your system meets all codes and regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Stafford?",
      "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Stafford typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase or budget allows. This flexibility is much greater than rooftop systems, ideal for growing Stafford families and businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual professional inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Stafford customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow."
