  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is monitoring important for Granville's hilltown solar systems?",
      "answer": "Granville's hilltown location creates unique solar challenges including terrain-specific shading from surrounding hills, elevation impacts on performance, variable weather patterns, increased snow loads, and potential wind exposure. Professional monitoring accounts for these factors, provides terrain-adjusted benchmarks, detects issues specific to hilltown installations, and ensures your system performs optimally despite these challenges."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does monitoring handle Granville's winter weather?",
      "answer": "Winter monitoring is essential in Granville due to significant snowfall and cold temperatures common in western Massachusetts hilltowns. Our platform detects snow coverage that reduces production, tracks cold weather efficiency impacts, monitors for ice or snow load issues, and provides realistic winter production expectations for your elevation. This helps you maintain maximum output during challenging winter months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I access monitoring remotely?",
      "answer": "Yes, complete remote access is included. Our mobile apps and web dashboards let you monitor your Granville solar system from anywhere. Whether you're traveling, at work, or own the property as a second home, you have 24/7 access to real-time production, historical data, alerts, and system status from any device."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when issues are detected?",
      "answer": "When problems are detected, you receive instant alerts via email, text, or app with specific details. Contact our team for expert evaluation - we often diagnose remotely using monitoring data. If service is needed, we schedule a technician visit to resolve issues quickly, minimizing lost production."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is monitoring compatible with my equipment?",
      "answer": "Yes, our solutions work with all major solar brands including Enphase, SolarEdge, Tesla, and more. For systems without monitoring, we can retrofit hardware for comprehensive tracking. We'll verify compatibility during your free assessment and recommend the best solution for your Granville installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What optimization services do you provide?",
      "answer": "Our optimization for Granville includes terrain-adjusted performance strategies, snow management recommendations, elevation-specific production planning, shading analysis from surrounding terrain, cold weather efficiency optimization, seasonal strategies for hilltowns, and maintenance scheduling. These can increase production by 5-15%."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does monitoring cost?",
      "answer": "Residential monitoring costs $15-30/month with installation fees of $300-800. Many modern inverters include basic monitoring at no charge. Premium platforms with hilltown-specific analytics available via subscription. We'll recommend the most cost-effective solution during your free assessment."
