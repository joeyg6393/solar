 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available for Wales, MA residents in 2024?",
   "answer": "Wales homeowners can access the flexible financing options covering complete system costs including professional installation. Massachusetts also offers the highly valuable SMART program providing 10-20 years of solar incentive payments, net metering that credits your utility account for excess solar production, and various state tax benefits. Our consultation identifies all benefits applicable to your Wales property for maximum savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options do you offer in Wales?",
   "answer": "We provide multiple financing paths for Wales residents: solar loans with 5-25 year terms and competitive rates starting at 2.99% APR, solar leases requiring no upfront cost with fixed predictable monthly payments, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) where you pay only for the electricity your system generates. Zero-down solar loans available for qualified applicants. During your free consultation, we determine which option provides optimal financial benefits for your specific situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much can Wales homeowners save by installing solar?",
   "answer": "Savings vary based on current electricity usage, solar system size, and chosen financing method, but most Wales homeowners reduce electric bills by 75-95%. Over 25 years, cumulative savings typically range from $37,000 to $85,000. The competitive pricing plus MA SMART program immediately reduces installation costs by thousands of dollars. We provide precise savings calculations based on your actual Wales utility rates and consumption during consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What credit score is required for solar financing in Wales?",
   "answer": "While credit scores of 650+ typically qualify for the best solar loan rates and terms, we partner with multiple lenders serving various credit profiles. Even with less-than-perfect credit, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal or no credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we assess your unique credit situation and identify the most suitable financing solutions available to you."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does the solar financing approval process take in Wales?",
   "answer": "From initial consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks total. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours of your request, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and financing applications usually receive approval within 5-7 business days after submission. Once approved, solar installation in Wales begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting requirements and weather conditions."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is your solar financing consultation really free for Wales residents?",
   "answer": "Absolutely yes! Our Wales solar financing consultation is 100% free with absolutely zero obligation to proceed. We provide complete property assessments, detailed energy audits, financial projections, and comprehensive incentive research at no cost to you. We believe in empowering homeowners through education for informed decision-making. You only move forward if the financial benefits clearly make sense for your situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Wales home?",
   "answer": "If you own your solar system through a loan, you have several options when selling your Wales property: pay off the remaining loan balance at closing using sale proceeds, transfer the loan obligation to the home buyer with lender approval, or factor the loan payoff into your asking sale price. Research consistently shows that solar systems increase home values by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Wales property significantly more attractive to buyers. We discuss these scenarios thoroughly during consultation."
