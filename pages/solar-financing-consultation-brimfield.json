      "answer": "Brimfield homeowners can access the flexible financing options covering complete system costs. Massachusetts also offers the highly valuable SMART program providing 10-20 years of solar benefit payments, net metering that credits your utility account for excess production, and financing options.

    },
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options do you offer Brimfield homeowners?",
      "answer": "We provide multiple financing paths for Brimfield residents: solar loans with 5-25 year terms and competitive rates starting at 2.99% APR, solar leases requiring no upfront cost with fixed monthly payments, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) where you pay only for electricity generated. Zero-down solar loans available for qualified applicants. During your free consultation, we determine which option provides optimal financial benefits for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can Brimfield homeowners save by going solar?",
      "answer": "Savings vary based on current electricity usage, system size, and financing method, but most Brimfield homeowners reduce electric bills by 70-95%. Over 25 years, cumulative savings typically range from $35,000 to $80,000. The competitive pricing plus MA SMART program immediately reduces costs by thousands. We provide precise savings calculations based on your actual Brimfield utility rates during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What credit score is needed for solar financing in Brimfield?",
      "answer": "While credit scores of 650+ typically qualify for the best solar loan rates, we partner with multiple lenders serving various credit profiles. Even with less-than-perfect credit, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we assess your credit situation and identify the most suitable financing solutions for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar financing approval take in Brimfield?",
      "answer": "From initial consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and financing applications usually receive approval within 5-7 business days. Once approved, solar installation in Brimfield begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting and weather."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is your solar financing consultation truly free for Brimfield residents?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our Brimfield solar financing consultation is 100% free with zero obligation to proceed. We provide complete property assessments, energy audits, financial projections, and incentive research at no cost. We believe in empowering homeowners through education for informed decision-making. You only move forward if the financial benefits clearly make sense for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Brimfield home?",
      "answer": "If you own your system through a loan, you have several options when selling: pay off the remaining balance at closing, transfer the loan to the buyer with lender approval, or factor the payoff into your sale price. Research shows solar systems typically increase home value by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Brimfield property more attractive to buyers. We discuss these scenarios thoroughly during consultation."
