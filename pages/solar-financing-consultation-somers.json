   "answer": "While credit scores of 650 or higher typically qualify for the best solar loan rates, we partner with multiple lenders serving various credit profiles.

During your confidential consultation, we'll assess your credit situation and identify the most suitable financing solutions for you."

  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Somers home?",
   "answer": "If you own your solar system through a loan, you have several options when selling your Somers home: pay off the remaining loan balance at closing using sale proceeds, transfer the loan to the home buyer with lender approval, or factor the payoff into your asking price. Research shows solar systems typically increase home value by more than the remaining loan balance. We discuss these scenarios thoroughly during consultation."
