  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does EV charger installation take in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Windsor Locks are completed in 3-5 hours for straightforward installations. If electrical panel upgrades are needed, the process may take 6-8 hours or be split across two visits. We'll provide an accurate timeline during your free consultation after assessing your home's electrical system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to upgrade my electrical panel for an EV charger?",
      "answer": "It depends on your current panel capacity and available circuits. Most Level 2 EV chargers require a dedicated 40-60 amp circuit. If your Windsor Locks home has an older 100-amp panel or limited available capacity, an upgrade to 200-amp service may be recommended. Our electricians will assess this during the free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What EV charger brands do you install in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "We install all major EV charger brands including Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox, Grizzl-E, Emporia, Wallbox Pulsar Plus, and more. We'll recommend the best charger based on your vehicle, budget, and desired features like Wi-Fi connectivity and smart charging capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get financing options or rebates for EV charger installation in Connecticut?",
      "answer": "Yes! The federal government offers a financing of 30% of installation costs up to $1,000 for EV charger installations. Connecticut also periodically offers financing options through Energize CT. Additionally, if you pair your EV charger with a solar panel system, you may qualify for the competitive pricing of 30% with no cap. We'll help you navigate all financing options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my EV charger work with any electric vehicle?",
      "answer": "Yes! All modern electric vehicles sold in North America use the standard J1772 charging connector, which is compatible with all Level 2 home chargers. Tesla vehicles come with an adapter, and Tesla Wall Connectors can charge any EV with the appropriate adapter. We'll ensure your charger is compatible with your specific vehicle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install an outdoor EV charger in Windsor Locks?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We install both indoor (garage) and outdoor (driveway) EV chargers. Outdoor installations use weather-resistant, NEMA 3R or 4 rated chargers designed to withstand Connecticut's climate including snow, rain, and temperature extremes. We'll recommend the best location based on your parking situation and electrical panel location."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much faster is a Level 2 charger compared to a regular outlet?",
      "answer": "A Level 2 home charger is 7-10 times faster than a standard 120V outlet. While a regular outlet provides about 3-5 miles of range per hour of charging, a Level 2 charger delivers 25-50 miles of range per hour depending on your vehicle and charger output. This means you can fully charge most EVs overnight in 4-8 hours instead of 24+ hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle permits and inspections for Windsor Locks installations?",
      "answer": "Yes! We handle all permit applications with the Windsor Locks Building Department and coordinate required electrical inspections. The permit cost is typically included in our installation quote. Our installations are always code-compliant and designed to pass inspection on the first visit."
