  },
  {

  },
  {
   "question": "How much can Indian Orchard homeowners save by going solar?",
   "answer": "Savings vary based on current electricity usage, system size, and financing method, but most Indian Orchard homeowners reduce electric bills by 70-95%. Over 25 years, cumulative savings typically range from $35,000 to $80,000. The competitive pricing plus MA SMART program immediately reduces costs by thousands. We provide precise savings calculations based on your actual Springfield utility rates during consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What credit score is needed for solar financing in Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "While credit scores of 650+ typically qualify for the best solar loan rates, we partner with multiple lenders serving various credit profiles. Even with less-than-perfect credit, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we assess your credit situation and identify the most suitable financing solutions for you."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar financing approval take in Indian Orchard?",
   "answer": "From initial consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and financing applications usually receive approval within 5-7 business days. Once approved, solar installation in Indian Orchard begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting and scheduling."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is your solar financing consultation truly free for Indian Orchard residents?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our Indian Orchard solar financing consultation is 100% free with zero obligation to proceed. We provide complete property assessments, energy audits, financial projections, and incentive research at no cost. We believe in empowering homeowners through education for informed decision-making. You only move forward if the financial benefits clearly make sense for you."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Indian Orchard home?",
   "answer": "If you own your system through a loan, you have several options when selling: pay off the remaining balance at closing, transfer the loan to the buyer with lender approval, or factor the payoff into your sale price. Research shows solar systems typically increase home value by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Indian Orchard property more attractive to buyers. We discuss these scenarios thoroughly during consultation."
