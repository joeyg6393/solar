  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does commercial solar give my Sixteen Acres business cost control?",
      "answer": "Solar provides predictable energy costs for 25+ years immune to utility rate increases. Your solar payments (if financed) or cost recovery is fixed while utility rates typically rise 3-5% annually. After payback (5-7 years), you have essentially free electricity - complete cost control."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my energy costs if utility rates keep increasing?",
      "answer": "While utility customers see costs rise indefinitely, your Sixteen Acres business enjoys fixed, predictable solars. As rates increase, your savings grow larger each year. Solar essentially locks in today's rates for 25+ years while competitors face escalating costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I still control costs if my business energy needs change?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can design expandable systems for growing Sixteen Acres businesses. Start with current needs and add capacity later. Alternatively, oversizing initially provides cost control for future growth. Battery storage can also be added to maximize solar utilization as needs evolve."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the investment required to gain energy cost control?",
      "answer": "Commercial solar in Sixteen Acres ranges from $60,000 to $700,000+ depending on your cost control goals. With competitive pricing, MACRS depreciation, and SMART revenue, net investment is approximately 50% of list price - one-time cost for decades of control."
    },
    {
      "question": "How predictable are solar system costs over 25+ years?",
      "answer": "Extremely predictable. If financed, payments are fixed. If purchased, costs are minimal (occasional cleaning, monitoring). Our warranties cover major components for 10-25 years. Compare this predictability to volatile utility rates that increase unpredictably year after year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can financing help me achieve cost control without large upfront investment?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Commercial solar financing provides immediate cost control with predictable monthly payments typically lower than current utility costs. You achieve cost control from day one while preserving capital - immediate positive cash flow with long-term predictability."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Massachusetts SMART program enhance cost control?",
      "answer": "SMART provides predictable monthly revenue for 10-20 years - guaranteed payments adding to your cost control and savings. These fixed payments are known in advance, providing additional financial predictability. We manage complete SMART enrollment for Sixteen Acres businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if equipment fails - does that affect my cost control?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive warranties protect your cost control: 25-year panel warranties, 10-year workmanship, and 12-25 year inverter coverage. Most failures are covered at no cost. We also offer maintenance agreements ensuring your cost-control system operates optimally for decades."
