 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "Most East Longmeadow residential systems require approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet of unshaded land for a typical 10kW installation. This is about the size of a large backyard. During our free site assessment, we'll evaluate your East Longmeadow property and recommend the optimal system size and placement."
  },
  {
   "question": "Are ground-mount systems worth the investment in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "Yes! While ground-mount systems cost 10-15% more initially, they typically produce 10-25% more energy than rooftop systems due to optimal positioning and better cooling. For East Longmeadow properties with roof challenges or those wanting maximum production, ground-mount systems offer superior long-term value."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are required in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "East Longmeadow ground-mount installations require building permits from the Town Building Department and electrical permits. Depending on your property's zoning and system size, additional approvals may be needed. We handle all permitting and ensure compliance with East Longmeadow's regulations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in East Longmeadow?",
   "answer": "After permit approval, most residential ground-mount installations in East Longmeadow take 3-5 days to complete. The permitting process typically requires 4-8 weeks. We provide a complete timeline during consultation and keep you informed throughout your project."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do ground-mount systems work in East Longmeadow winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are engineered for New England weather, including East Longmeadow's snow and ice conditions. The elevated panel design allows snow to slide off easily, and ground-level access makes snow removal simple when needed. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations in winter."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for East Longmeadow solar?",
   "answer": "East Longmeadow residents qualify for the federal solar financing, Massachusetts SMART program (10-20 years of production benefits), and property tax exemptions. Combined, these benefits can reduce your net system cost by 40-60%. We help you maximize all available East Longmeadow benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Ground-mount systems are easily expandable. We can design your initial East Longmeadow installation with future expansion in mind, allowing you to add panels as your budget or energy needs grow. This flexibility is a key advantage of ground-mount solar."
