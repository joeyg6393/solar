Our monitoring, especially with panel-level tracking, identifies exactly which panels are affected by shading and when. This data helps you make informed decisions about strategic tree trimming, understand seasonal production patterns, and optimize your system's performance despite suburban landscaping. The detailed analytics show the cost-benefit of any shading mitigation efforts."

   "answer": "Yes, our monitoring platforms include user-friendly mobile apps for iOS and Android that provide complete access to your system's performance data. Check real-time production, review historical data, receive push notifications for alerts, view detailed analytics, track savings, and monitor system health all from your smartphone or tablet, whether you're home in Sixteen Acres or anywhere in the world."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens when monitoring detects an issue?",
   "answer": "When our monitoring platform detects underperformance or equipment issues, you receive instant alerts via email, text, or app notification with specific details about what was detected. You can contact our team for expert evaluation - we can often diagnose problems remotely using the monitoring data. If service is needed, we schedule a technician visit to resolve the issue quickly, minimizing lost energy production and protecting your savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is monitoring compatible with my existing solar system?",
   "answer": "Yes, our monitoring solutions are compatible with virtually all solar equipment brands including Enphase, SolarEdge, Tesla, Fronius, SMA, Generac, LG, SunPower, and more. If your current system lacks monitoring capabilities, we can retrofit monitoring hardware to provide comprehensive tracking. During your free assessment, we'll evaluate your specific equipment and recommend the best monitoring solution for your Sixteen Acres installation."
  },
  {

  },
  {
   "question": "How much does solar monitoring cost in Sixteen Acres?",
