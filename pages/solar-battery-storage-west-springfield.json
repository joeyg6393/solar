  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar battery storage cost in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Tesla Powerwall installation in West Springfield typically costs $12,200-$16,800 before benefits. After applying the competitive pricing and Massachusetts state programs, your net cost is approximately $9,000-$12,400. Most West Springfield homeowners install 1-2 Powerwalls depending on backup needs and home size. We provide free detailed quotes and financing options with $0 down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage work during West Springfield's winter storms?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Solar battery storage is specifically designed to provide backup power during outages caused by West Springfield's winter storms. When the grid goes down, your battery automatically powers your home's critical circuits. With proper sizing, a Tesla Powerwall can keep essential systems running for 24+ hours, and it recharges when your solar panels produce energy or when grid power returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my existing West Springfield solar system?",
      "answer": "Yes! Battery storage can be retrofitted to virtually any existing solar panel system in West Springfield. Whether your solar installation is 1 year old or 15 years old, we can integrate battery storage seamlessly. The retrofit involves installing the battery unit, potentially upgrading your inverter, and updating electrical connections. Most West Springfield retrofit installations take just 1-2 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will a battery power my West Springfield home?",
      "answer": "One Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits in a typical West Springfield home for 24-36 hours during an outage, including lights, refrigerator, internet, and select outlets. For whole-home backup including HVAC and major appliances, most homes need 2-3 Powerwalls. During your free consultation, we'll calculate your specific backup duration based on your energy usage patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for battery storage in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "West Springfield residents qualify for the flexible financing options on battery storage when installed with solar panels. You can also participate in Massachusetts' ConnectedSolutions program, earning $225-$375 annually per Powerwall. Combined with energy bill savings through time-of-use optimization, battery storage delivers excellent financial returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Physical installation of solar battery storage in West Springfield takes 1-2 days for most residential projects. The complete timeline from consultation to activation is typically 3-4 weeks, including system design, permitting with West Springfield, Eversource interconnection approval, installation, and final inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which battery is better: Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ Battery?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent choices for West Springfield homes! Tesla Powerwall offers 13.5 kWh per unit in a proven all-in-one design - ideal for most applications. Enphase IQ Battery provides modular scalability (start with 3.3 kWh, expand as needed) and integrates perfectly with Enphase microinverters. We'll recommend the best option based on your existing solar setup, backup requirements, and budget during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage increase my West Springfield home's value?",
      "answer": "Yes! Studies consistently show that solar + battery storage systems increase home values by 4-6% in Massachusetts. West Springfield homebuyers increasingly seek energy-independent homes with backup power, especially after experiencing storm-related outages. Your battery system transfers to future owners with remaining warranty coverage, making it a valuable selling feature."
