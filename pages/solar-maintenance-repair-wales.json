 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often do solar panels need professional maintenance in Wales?",
   "answer": "We recommend annual professional maintenance for most Wales solar systems. Properties with heavy tree coverage or significant bird activity may benefit from semi-annual service. Wales' rural New England setting means exposure to seasonal pollen, tree debris, and environmental factors that make regular maintenance essential for sustained peak performance and system longevity."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs my Wales solar system needs repair?",
   "answer": "Common warning signs include decreased energy production compared to previous months, monitoring system error messages or alerts, inverter warning lights or unusual sounds, visible panel damage or discoloration, loose mounting hardware, and unexpectedly high electric bills. If you notice any of these issues with your Wales system, contact us for a free diagnostic evaluation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can dirty solar panels really reduce my energy savings?",
   "answer": "Yes, significantly. Research shows accumulated dirt, pollen, bird droppings, and debris can reduce solar panel efficiency by 15-25% or more. In Wales' rural environment with abundant trees and seasonal pollen, this buildup occurs faster than in urban areas. Professional cleaning often pays for itself within months through increased energy production and savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service all types of solar equipment?",
   "answer": "Yes, our Wales technicians are trained and certified to service all major solar panel brands (SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, REC, Panasonic, etc.) and all inverter types including string inverters (SMA, Fronius, SolarEdge), microinverters (Enphase, APsystems), and hybrid systems. We maintain manufacturer relationships for technical support and genuine parts."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your solar maintenance service?",
   "answer": "Our comprehensive Wales maintenance includes professional panel cleaning with purified water, complete electrical system inspection, inverter performance testing and diagnostics, connection testing and tightening, mounting system structural checks, monitoring system verification, performance measurement and comparison, thermal imaging when needed, and a detailed service report with photos and expert recommendations."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is solar panel maintenance really worth the cost?",
   "answer": "Absolutely. Annual maintenance ($299-$599) typically pays for itself through increased energy production from professional cleaning alone. Add in the value of preventing repairs that often cost $1,000-$5,000, validating warranties, and extending system life by 5-10 years, and the return on investment is substantial. For Wales solar owners, maintenance is one of the smartest investments in system performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency solar repair services?",
   "answer": "Yes, we provide emergency repair services for urgent situations including storm damage, complete system failures, electrical hazards, and major inverter malfunctions. We understand every day your Wales solar system is down means lost energy production and higher costs. Our emergency team typically responds within 24 hours to diagnose problems and begin repairs."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance help keep my solar warranty valid?",
   "answer": "Yes, most solar panel and inverter manufacturers require proof of regular professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. We provide detailed documentation for every Wales service visit that satisfies these requirements. Proper maintenance also prevents many issues that would otherwise require warranty service or expensive out-of-pocket repairs, protecting your investment."
