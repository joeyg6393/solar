    {
      "question": "What is the investment for solar roof in South Hadley?",
      "answer": "South Hadley solar roof installations typically range $45,000-$85,000 before benefits, varying with roof size and complexity. Massachusetts offers exceptional benefits: the competitive pricing saves $12,000-$22,000, plus SMART program rebates. We offer premium financing and will provide a detailed quote for your South Hadley home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the installation process take?",
      "answer": "Physical installation takes 5-10 days for most South Hadley homes. The complete process from consultation to activation spans 8-12 weeks, including design, permitting with South Hadley building department, installation, and Eversource interconnection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why choose Tesla Solar Roof over traditional panels?",
      "answer": "Tesla Solar Roof maintains South Hadley's architectural standards with seamless integration. It provides superior aesthetics, premium roofing protection, and maximizes home value. If your roof needs replacement, it combines both investments with better financial benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does solar roof perform well during Pioneer Valley winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs work effectively year-round in South Hadley. While snow can temporarily reduce output, panels operate more efficiently in cold temperatures. Most roofs shed snow naturally. Net metering credits summer overproduction for winter consumption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties protect my investment?",
      "answer": "Your South Hadley installation includes Tesla's 25-year performance warranty, comprehensive manufacturer warranties on all equipment, and our 10-year workmanship guarantee. Premium roofing materials are engineered for 50+ year lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I integrate battery storage?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Tesla Powerwall battery integration is available and recommended for all South Hadley installations. Battery storage provides nighttime solar usage, backup power during outages, and complete energy independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much energy will my South Hadley solar roof produce?",
      "answer": "Production depends on roof size, orientation, and shading. Typical South Hadley homes with south-facing solar roofs generate 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of household needs. We provide precise estimates during consultations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need roof replacement before solar installation?",
      "answer": "No! Tesla Solar Roof includes complete replacement. If your South Hadley roof needs replacement within 10-15 years, installing solar roof now maximizes available benefits while receiving both premium roofing and solar generation."
