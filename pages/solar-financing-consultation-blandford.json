We provide precise savings calculations based on your actual Blandford utility rates during consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "What credit score is needed for solar financing in Blandford?",
   "answer": "While credit scores of 650+ typically qualify for the best solar loan rates, we partner with multiple lenders serving various credit profiles. Even with less-than-perfect credit, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal credit requirements. During your confidential consultation, we assess your credit situation and identify the most suitable financing solutions for you."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar financing approval take in Blandford?",
   "answer": "From initial consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours, deliver comprehensive financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and financing applications usually receive approval within 5-7 business days. Once approved, solar installation in Blandford begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting and weather."

   "answer": "Absolutely! Our Blandford solar financing consultation is 100% free with zero obligation to proceed.

  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar loan if I sell my Blandford home?",
   "answer": "If you own your system through a loan, you have several options when selling: pay off the remaining balance at closing, transfer the loan to the buyer with lender approval, or factor the payoff into your sale price. Research shows solar systems typically increase home value by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Blandford property more attractive to buyers. We discuss these scenarios thoroughly during consultation."
