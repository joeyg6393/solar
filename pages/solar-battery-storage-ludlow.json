  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar battery storage cost in Ludlow?",
      "answer": "Tesla Powerwall installation in Ludlow typically costs $12,400-$16,600 before benefits. After applying the competitive pricing and Massachusetts rebates, your net investment is approximately $9,200-$12,300. Most Ludlow residents install 1-2 Powerwalls based on their backup needs and home size. We provide free detailed quotes and financing options with $0 down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage work during Ludlow's winter storms?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Solar battery storage is specifically designed to provide backup power during Ludlow's winter storms and ice events. When the grid goes down, your battery automatically powers your home's critical circuits. With proper sizing, a Tesla Powerwall can keep essential systems running for 24+ hours, and it recharges when your solar panels produce energy or when grid power returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add batteries to my existing Ludlow solar system?",
      "answer": "Yes! Battery storage can be retrofitted to virtually any existing solar panel system in Ludlow. Whether your solar installation is 1 year old or 15 years old, we can integrate battery storage seamlessly. The retrofit process involves installing the battery unit, potentially upgrading your inverter, and updating electrical connections. Most Ludlow retrofit installations take just 1-2 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will a battery power my Ludlow home during outages?",
      "answer": "One Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) can power essential circuits in a typical Ludlow home for 24-36 hours during an outage, including lights, refrigerator, internet, heating controls, and select outlets. For whole-home backup including HVAC and major appliances, most homes need 2-3 Powerwalls. We'll calculate your specific backup duration during our free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for battery storage in Ludlow?",
      "answer": "Ludlow homeowners qualify for the flexible financing options on battery storage when paired with solar panels. You can also participate in Massachusetts' ConnectedSolutions program, earning $225-$375 annually per Powerwall. Combined with energy savings through time-of-use optimization ($118-$215 monthly), battery storage delivers excellent financial returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Ludlow?",
      "answer": "Physical installation of solar battery storage in Ludlow takes 1-2 days for most residential projects. The complete process from initial consultation to system activation typically spans 3-4 weeks, including custom system design, permitting with the Town of Ludlow, utility interconnection approval, professional installation, and final inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tesla Powerwall vs Enphase IQ Battery - which is better for Ludlow?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent choices for Ludlow homes! Tesla Powerwall offers 13.5 kWh per unit in a proven all-in-one design - ideal for most residential applications. Enphase IQ Battery provides modular flexibility (start with 3.3 kWh, expand as needed) and integrates perfectly with Enphase microinverters. We'll recommend the best option based on your existing solar setup, backup requirements, and budget during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will battery storage increase my Ludlow home's value?",
      "answer": "Yes! Research consistently shows that solar + battery storage systems increase home values by 4-6% in Massachusetts. Ludlow homebuyers increasingly prioritize energy independence and backup power capability, especially after experiencing storm-related outages. Your battery system transfers to future owners with remaining warranty coverage, making it a valuable selling feature."
