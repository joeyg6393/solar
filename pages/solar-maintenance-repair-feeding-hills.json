 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should Feeding Hills homeowners schedule solar maintenance?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional solar maintenance at least annually for Feeding Hills residential systems. However, properties with heavy tree coverage or near roadways may benefit from biannual service to address increased pollen and dust accumulation. Spring cleaning (April-May) and fall maintenance (September-October) provide optimal year-round performance. Regular professional maintenance can improve energy production by 20-30% compared to neglected systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are warning signs my solar panels need repair?",
   "answer": "Watch for these indicators: significant drop in energy production compared to previous months, error codes or warning lights on your inverter display, visible damage to panels (cracks, discoloration), loose or corroded connections, moisture in junction boxes, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Feeding Hills solar installation, contact us immediately for professional inspection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional solar panel cleaning worth the investment?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! In Feeding Hills, environmental factors like pollen, dust, and bird droppings can reduce solar panel efficiency by 20-30%. Professional cleaning safely removes these contaminants and can restore near-original performance levels. For a typical Feeding Hills solar system, the improved energy production quickly offsets the cleaning cost, making it a smart investment that pays for itself."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you provide emergency solar repair in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "Yes! We offer 24/7 emergency solar repair service for critical issues including complete system failure, electrical hazards, inverter problems, and storm damage. Our Feeding Hills-area emergency team typically responds within 3-4 hours during business hours and 6-8 hours for after-hours emergencies. We arrive equipped with common parts to resolve most issues on the first visit."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you service solar systems installed by other companies?",
   "answer": "Definitely! We maintain and repair all brands and types of solar installations throughout Feeding Hills and Agawam, regardless of the original installer. Our NABCEP certified technicians are trained on all major solar equipment manufacturers and provide warranty-compliant service. Every solar system receives the same professional care and expertise."
  },
  {
   "question": "What does your annual maintenance contract include?",
   "answer": "Our Feeding Hills annual maintenance contracts include: two comprehensive service visits (spring and fall), thorough professional panel cleaning, complete system inspection, inverter diagnostics and firmware updates, electrical testing, detailed performance reports, priority scheduling for emergency repairs, and 15% discount on any repair parts or labor needed throughout the year."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much do solar panel repairs cost in Feeding Hills?",
   "answer": "Repair costs depend on the specific issue. Minor repairs like cleaning connections or resetting systems may be $150-300. Inverter component repairs range from $500-1,500. Full inverter replacement typically costs $1,500-3,500 depending on system size. Individual panel replacement is $300-600 per panel. We provide detailed estimates before starting work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance void my solar panel warranty?",
   "answer": "No - professional maintenance actually protects your warranty. Many solar panel manufacturers require proof of regular professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. We provide detailed service documentation that meets all manufacturer requirements. Our maintenance procedures comply with warranty terms and industry best practices, ensuring your coverage remains valid throughout the warranty period."
