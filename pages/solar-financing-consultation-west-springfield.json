 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much can West Springfield homeowners save with solar?",
   "answer": "West Springfield homeowners typically save $1,200-$2,000 annually on electricity bills with solar panels. Over 25 years, that's $30,000-$50,000 in total savings. Add the competitive pricing ($3,900-$9,100 immediate savings), Massachusetts SMART program payments ($20,000-$30,000 over 10 years), and annual net metering income ($1,400-$2,400), and the financial benefits become substantial. Your exact savings depend on system size, energy usage, and chosen financing method."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing is available in West Springfield?",
   "answer": "West Springfield residents can choose from: (1) Solar Loans - own your system with zero-down financing, qualify for all benefits, monthly payments often lower than electric bills; (2) Solar Leases - fixed monthly payments with no upfront costs; (3) PPAs - pay only for electricity produced at discounted rates; (4) Cash Purchase - upfront payment for maximum ROI. We'll compare all options during your free consultation based on your specific financial situation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I get solar with $0 down in West Springfield?",
   "answer": "Yes! Zero-down solar financing is widely available in West Springfield through solar loans, leases, and PPAs. Zero-down solar loans are especially popular because you own the system immediately, qualify for the competitive pricing and all financing options, and monthly payments are often lower than current electricity costs. We work with multiple lenders offering competitive rates for West Springfield customers."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar increase my property taxes in West Springfield?",
   "answer": "No! Massachusetts provides a 100% property tax exemption for solar systems for 20 years. While solar increases your West Springfield home's value by 3-4% ($15,000-$25,000 typically), you won't pay additional property taxes. This exemption is automatic throughout West Springfield and Massachusetts."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the payback period for solar in West Springfield?",
   "answer": "The average payback period in West Springfield is 6-9 years, factoring in the competitive pricing, SMART program payments, net metering income, and electricity savings. After payback, solar panels continue generating free electricity for 15-20+ years, representing $30,000-$60,000 in additional lifetime savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does the Massachusetts SMART program work?",
   "answer": "The SMART program pays West Springfield solar owners for every kWh produced for 10 years. Rates typically range from $0.25-$0.35/kWh. A 7kW residential system in West Springfield produces about 8,000-8,500 kWh annually, earning $2,000-$2,975 per year, or $20,000-$29,750 total over 10 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are net meterings worth in Massachusetts?",
   "answer": "net metering (Solar Renewable Energy Certificates) represent 1,000 kWh of solar production. You earn one net metering per MWh produced, sellable on the Massachusetts net metering market at $200-$300 historically. A 7kW system in West Springfield produces 7-8 net metering annually, generating $1,400-$2,400 in additional yearly income for 10-15 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "How does net metering benefit West Springfield solar customers?",
   "answer": "Net metering credits you at full retail rates for excess solar electricity sent to the grid. Credits accumulate and offset electricity purchased during nighttime or cloudy periods. With proper system sizing, many West Springfield homeowners reduce annual electricity costs to just the monthly connection fee."
