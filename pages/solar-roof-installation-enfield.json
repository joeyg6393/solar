 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "What is the cost of solar roof installation in Enfield, CT?",
   "answer": "Solar roof installation in Enfield typically ranges from $45,000-$85,000 before benefits. With the competitive pricing, you'll save $11,700-$22,100 immediately. Connecticut solar benefits provide additional savings. Most Enfield homeowners see complete payback in 12-16 years through electricity savings averaging $2,500-$4,500 annually."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long do solar roofs last in Connecticut weather?",
   "answer": "Our solar roofs are built for Connecticut's demanding climate. Solar shingles are engineered to last 25-30+ years with minimal maintenance, far outlasting traditional asphalt shingles (15-20 years). They're three times stronger than standard roofing, with Class A fire rating and superior resistance to hail, wind, snow, and temperature extremes common in Enfield."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will a solar roof work during Enfield's snowy winters?",
   "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs actually perform well in Enfield winters. Dark solar shingles absorb heat and help snow melt faster than traditional roofing. While production is lower during short winter days, annual production is optimized for Connecticut's climate. Our systems are designed to handle heavy snow loads typical of Hartford County winters."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I afford a solar roof in Enfield with financing options?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We offer $0 down solar loans, home equity financing, and PACE programs specifically for Enfield homeowners. With the competitive pricing and Connecticut benefits, combined with immediate electricity savings, most customers achieve positive cash flow from day one. Monthly loan payments are typically less than current electricity bills."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much value does a solar roof add to my Enfield home?",
   "answer": "Studies show solar installations increase home values by $20,000-$40,000 on average in Connecticut. Solar roofs add even more value because they combine a brand-new roof with energy generation. Enfield homes with solar sell faster and command premium prices, especially as energy costs rise and buyers prioritize sustainability."
  },
  {
   "question": "What permits are required for solar roof installation in Enfield?",
   "answer": "Solar roof installations in Enfield require building permits from the town building department and electrical permits. We handle all permitting, including zoning approvals and utility interconnection agreements with Eversource. Our team is intimately familiar with Enfield's requirements and ensures smooth, fast approval."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I integrate battery storage with my Enfield solar roof?",
   "answer": "Yes! We recommend pairing solar roofs with battery storage systems like Tesla Powerwall for maximum energy independence. Battery backup stores excess daytime solar production for use at night or during power outages. This is especially valuable in Enfield where winter storms can cause outages. We can design integrated solar roof + battery systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do solar roofs compare to traditional solar panels for Enfield homes?",
   "answer": "Solar roofs offer superior aesthetics (integrated vs. mounted), complete roof replacement, and often better warranties. They're ideal if your Enfield home needs a new roof anyway, you value curb appeal, or want cutting-edge technology. Traditional panels are more economical if your roof is in good condition. We'll help you choose the best option during your free consultation."
