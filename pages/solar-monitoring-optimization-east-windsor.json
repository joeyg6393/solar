    {
      "question": "What is solar monitoring and why do I need it in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "Solar monitoring is a technology platform that tracks your solar system's performance in real-time, providing detailed data on energy production, equipment health, and system efficiency. In East Windsor, professional monitoring is essential because Connecticut's variable weather can impact production, equipment issues can occur without visible signs, and monitoring catches problems immediately before they significantly reduce your savings. It's the best way to ensure your solar investment performs optimally year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will I know if there's a problem with my solar system?",
      "answer": "Our monitoring platform sends instant alerts via email, text message, or app notification the moment any performance issue is detected. You'll be notified of underperformance, equipment failures, inverter problems, unusual production drops, or any anomalies in your system's operation. Alerts include specific details about what was detected, allowing you to contact our team for rapid diagnosis and service scheduling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can monitoring work with my existing solar equipment?",
      "answer": "Yes, our monitoring solutions are compatible with virtually all solar equipment brands and models including Enphase, SolarEdge, Tesla Powerwall, Fronius, SMA, Generac, LG, SunPower, and more. If your current system lacks monitoring capabilities, we can retrofit monitoring hardware to provide comprehensive tracking. During your free assessment, we'll evaluate your specific equipment and recommend the best monitoring solution for your East Windsor installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in solar system optimization?",
      "answer": "Our optimization service includes regular expert review of your performance data, identification of underperforming panels or equipment, recommendations for cleaning schedules based on local East Windsor conditions, inverter settings adjustments, energy usage timing suggestions, seasonal performance strategies, shading analysis and mitigation recommendations, proactive maintenance scheduling, and ongoing support to maximize your system's energy production and efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does solar monitoring cost in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "Residential solar monitoring typically costs $15-30 per month, with one-time installation fees of $300-800 depending on system complexity. Many modern inverters include basic monitoring at no additional charge. Premium platforms with advanced features, panel-level monitoring, expert support, and detailed analytics are available through subscription. Commercial systems receive custom quotes. We'll recommend the most cost-effective solution during your free assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can monitoring help me save money on my electric bills?",
      "answer": "Yes, monitoring helps maximize savings in several ways: detecting issues immediately minimizes lost production, optimization recommendations can increase output by 5-15%, tracking consumption patterns helps you shift usage to solar production hours, identifying equipment degradation early prevents expensive repairs, and providing data for utility net metering verification ensures you receive proper credits. Many customers find monitoring pays for itself through increased production and prevented issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What information can I access through my monitoring dashboard?",
      "answer": "Your monitoring dashboard provides current power production (in watts/kilowatts), daily/monthly/yearly energy generation totals, system efficiency percentages, individual panel or inverter performance (with advanced monitoring), battery status (if applicable), real-time and historical savings calculations, weather data and impact analysis, environmental benefits (carbon offset), performance vs. expected output comparisons, alerts and notifications, and detailed analytics for troubleshooting or optimization."
