 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should solar panels be professionally cleaned and maintained in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional maintenance at least once per year for most residential systems in Windsor Locks. If your property is near trees, agricultural areas, or experiences heavy pollen, semi-annual cleaning may be beneficial. Connecticut's seasonal weather - including winter snow and spring pollen - makes regular maintenance especially important to maintain peak efficiency."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs my solar panels need repair?",
   "answer": "Common warning signs include decreased energy production, error messages on your monitoring system, visible damage to panels or mounting hardware, inverter warning lights, and unusual sounds from the inverter. If you notice your energy bills increasing despite having solar, it's time for a professional inspection. Our Windsor Locks team can diagnose issues quickly."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can dirty solar panels really reduce energy production?",
   "answer": "Yes, significantly. Studies show that dirt, dust, pollen, and bird droppings can reduce solar panel efficiency by 15-25% or more. In Windsor Locks, seasonal pollen and winter residue are particularly problematic. Professional cleaning can restore your system to peak performance, often paying for itself through increased energy production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you service all brands of solar panels and inverters?",
   "answer": "Yes, our certified technicians are trained to service all major solar panel brands including SunPower, LG, Canadian Solar, Trina, and more. We work with all inverter types including string inverters, microinverters (Enphase, SolarEdge), and power optimizers. We maintain relationships with manufacturers to ensure access to genuine replacement parts."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar panel maintenance take?",
   "answer": "A typical residential maintenance visit takes 2-4 hours depending on system size and accessibility. This includes comprehensive inspection, cleaning, electrical testing, and documentation. Repairs may take longer depending on the issue. We always provide time estimates upfront and work efficiently to minimize any disruption to your Windsor Locks property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is solar panel maintenance covered by my system warranty?",
   "answer": "Most solar panel warranties require regular maintenance to remain valid, but the maintenance itself is typically not covered. However, proper maintenance prevents many warranty claims and extends system life. We document all maintenance work, which can be important for warranty claims. Some of our maintenance plans include priority repair services and discounted parts."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens if you find a problem during maintenance?",
   "answer": "If we discover any issues during your maintenance visit, we'll explain the problem clearly and provide repair options with transparent pricing. Minor repairs can often be completed immediately. For more complex repairs requiring parts or additional time, we'll provide a detailed quote and schedule the work at your convenience. Your safety and system performance are our top priorities."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you handle emergency solar panel repairs in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "Yes, we offer emergency repair services for urgent situations like storm damage, electrical hazards, or complete system failures. We understand that solar system downtime means lost energy production and higher utility bills. Our Windsor Locks emergency response team can often provide same-day or next-day service to get your system back online quickly and safely."
