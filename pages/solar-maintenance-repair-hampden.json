 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should Hampden homeowners have solar panels maintained?",
   "answer": "We recommend professional solar maintenance at least annually for Hampden residential systems. However, properties with significant tree coverage should consider biannual service - spring cleaning to remove pollen and winter debris, and fall maintenance to prepare for winter and remove autumn leaves. Regular professional maintenance can improve energy production by 20-30% compared to unmaintained systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can wildlife damage solar panels in rural Hampden?",
   "answer": "Yes, wildlife common in rural Hampden can interfere with solar installations. Squirrels may chew wiring, birds often build nests under panels causing drainage issues and fire hazards, and occasionally larger animals can damage ground-mount systems. During maintenance visits, we inspect for wildlife damage and can install protective measures like critter guards and bird deterrents that protect your investment without harming local wildlife."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are signs my Hampden solar panels need professional service?",
   "answer": "Warning signs include: noticeable decrease in energy production, error messages on your inverter display, visible accumulation of leaves or debris on panels, physical damage like cracks or loose connections, moisture in electrical boxes, or complete system shutdown. If you notice any of these issues with your Hampden solar installation, contact us promptly for professional inspection."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional solar cleaning necessary in Hampden?",
   "answer": "Yes! Hampden's rural, wooded environment means solar panels accumulate significant pollen, leaves, tree sap, and bird droppings that can reduce efficiency by 20-30%. Professional cleaning safely removes these contaminants using specialized equipment and proper safety gear for rooftop work. DIY attempts risk personal injury and potential panel damage that could void warranties."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency solar repair in Hampden?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We provide 24/7 emergency solar repair service for critical issues including complete system failure, electrical hazards, inverter problems, and storm damage. Our Hampden-area emergency team typically responds within 4-6 hours during business hours and 6-8 hours for after-hours emergencies. We arrive equipped with common parts to resolve most issues on the first visit."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you service solar systems installed by other companies?",
   "answer": "Yes! We maintain and repair all brands and types of solar installations throughout Hampden, regardless of who performed the original installation. Our NABCEP certified technicians are trained on all major solar equipment manufacturers and provide warranty-compliant service. Every Hampden solar system receives the same expert, professional care."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance contract?",
   "answer": "Our Hampden annual maintenance contracts include: two comprehensive service visits (typically spring and fall), thorough professional cleaning, complete system inspection, inverter diagnostics and firmware updates, electrical testing, detailed performance reports, priority scheduling for emergency repairs, and 15% discount on any repair parts or labor needed throughout the year."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much do solar panel repairs typically cost?",
   "answer": "Repair costs vary depending on the specific issue. Simple repairs like cleaning connections or resetting systems may be $150-300. Inverter component repairs range from $500-1,500. Full inverter replacement typically costs $1,500-3,500 depending on system size. Individual panel replacement is $300-600 per panel. We always provide detailed estimates before beginning work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties."
