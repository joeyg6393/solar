  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What makes solar roofs ideal for Amherst homes?",
      "answer": "Amherst's combination of environmental consciousness, high electricity rates, and excellent solar exposure makes it perfect for solar roofs. The integrated shingle design appeals to Amherst's aesthetic standards while delivering superior energy production. Solar roofs work beautifully with both historic properties near UMass and newer developments, providing clean energy without compromising architectural integrity. Plus, Amherst's highly educated community appreciates the advanced technology and long-term environmental benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I save with a solar roof in Amherst?",
      "answer": "Amherst homeowners typically save $1,500-$2,500 annually on electricity costs with solar roofs. Over 25 years, that's $37,500-$62,500 in cumulative savings. When you factor in the competitive pricing, Massachusetts SMART program payments (often $200-400 monthly for 10 years), and increased home value, the total financial benefit often exceeds $100,000. Many Amherst residents achieve complete energy independence, eliminating electric bills entirely while contributing clean energy to the community grid."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are solar roofs approved for Amherst's historic districts?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs are often preferred over traditional panels in Amherst's historic areas because of their seamless integration and low-profile design. We work closely with the Amherst Historical Commission to ensure installations meet preservation guidelines. Our solar shingles blend naturally with traditional roofing materials, making them virtually indistinguishable from standard roofs. We have extensive experience with historic properties throughout Amherst and can navigate all necessary approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do solar roofs perform during Amherst winters?",
      "answer": "Solar roofs excel in Amherst's winter climate. Solar panels actually generate electricity more efficiently in cold temperatures - they just need sunlight, not heat. Our systems are specifically engineered for New England snow loads and generate enough heat to help snow slide off naturally. Clear winter days often produce excellent energy, and annual production accounts for seasonal variations. Over 12+ months, Amherst's solar exposure delivers strong returns that make solar roofs highly cost-effective."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the solar roof warranty?",
      "answer": "Your Amherst solar roof includes comprehensive protection: 25-year power output warranty guaranteeing at least 85% efficiency throughout the warranty period, 25-year roof weatherization warranty protecting against leaks and weather damage, 10-year workmanship guarantee covering installation quality, and manufacturer component warranties of 25+ years. All warranties are fully transferable to future homeowners, enhancing resale value. We also provide lifetime support for monitoring and maintenance questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can UMass faculty and staff get special financing?",
      "answer": "While we don't offer UMass-specific programs, we work with multiple financing partners offering competitive rates for all Amherst residents. Many lenders provide special programs for highly qualified borrowers, and UMass employees often qualify for best-rate financing. We also help you maximize Massachusetts Clean Energy Center programs and flexible benefits that substantially reduce net costs. Schedule a consultation to explore all financing options available to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar roofs work with Amherst's net metering program?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Amherst participates in Massachusetts' excellent net metering program, which credits you for excess solar energy sent to the grid. During sunny summer days, your solar roof typically produces more energy than you consume - those credits accumulate and offset energy drawn from the grid during evenings or cloudy days. This maximizes the value of your solar production and can reduce your annual electric bills to near zero. We handle all net metering paperwork and utility coordination."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar roof installation take in Amherst?",
      "answer": "The complete process from signing to system activation typically takes 8-12 weeks in Amherst, including design, permitting with the Town of Amherst, installation, and utility interconnection. The actual installation work usually takes 5-7 days depending on roof size and weather. We schedule around your preferences and work efficiently to minimize disruption. Our project managers coordinate every detail and keep you informed throughout the process."
