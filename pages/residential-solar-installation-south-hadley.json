 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much can I save with solar panels in South Hadley?",
   "answer": "South Hadley homeowners typically save 50-70% on electricity bills with solar panels. The average South Hadley household saves $1,200-$2,000 annually on electricity costs. Over 25+ years, that's $30,000-$50,000 in total savings. With Massachusetts' net metering and net metering programs, your South Hadley savings can be even higher."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available in South Hadley, MA?",
   "answer": "South Hadley residents benefit from excellent solar benefits: flexible financing options, Massachusetts Solar Renewable Energy Credits (net metering) worth $1,000-$3,000 per year, increased home value, professional service on equipment, and net metering credits at full retail rates. We help maximize your savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar installation take in South Hadley?",
   "answer": "The physical installation on your South Hadley home typically takes 1-3 days. The complete process from contract to activation averages 6-10 weeks, including custom design, Town of South Hadley permitting, equipment procurement, and Eversource interconnection approval. We manage every step efficiently."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work during South Hadley winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures. While winter days are shorter in South Hadley, modern solar technology still produces significant energy even on cloudy days. Snow melts quickly on tilted panels. The Pioneer Valley's excellent solar irradiance makes South Hadley ideal for year-round production."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels increase my South Hadley home's value?",
   "answer": "Yes! Studies show solar panels increase home values by $15,000-$25,000 on average in Massachusetts. South Hadley homes with solar installations sell faster and at premium prices compared to similar non-solar homes. Solar is a major value-add that attracts environmentally conscious buyers."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if my South Hadley roof needs replacement?",
   "answer": "We conduct a thorough roof assessment during your free consultation. If your South Hadley home's roof is nearing end-of-life, we recommend replacement before solar installation. We can coordinate with trusted local roofers or handle roofing ourselves. Solar panels actually protect and extend roof lifespan."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I monitor my solar system's performance?",
   "answer": "Every installation includes real-time monitoring through intuitive smartphone apps. You can track energy production, consumption, and savings from anywhere. The system alerts you to any issues, and we remotely monitor all South Hadley installations to ensure peak performance. Most homeowners check production daily!"
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens when I produce more energy than I use in South Hadley?",
   "answer": "Massachusetts has excellent net metering policies. When your South Hadley solar system generates more electricity than you consume, the surplus is fed to the grid and you receive full retail rate credits on your Eversource bill. Credits roll over month-to-month, so summer overproduction offsets winter usage."
