      "answer": "While credit scores of 650 or above typically qualify for the most favorable solar loan rates and terms, we work with multiple financing partners serving diverse credit profiles and situations. Even with lower credit scores, solar lease and PPA options may be available with minimal or no credit requirements.

      "question": "What happens to my solar system if I sell my Sixteen Acres home?",
      "answer": "If you own your solar system through a loan, you have several options when selling your Sixteen Acres property: pay off the remaining loan balance at closing using sale proceeds, transfer the loan obligation to the home buyer with lender approval, or include the loan payoff amount in your home's asking sale price. Research and studies consistently show that solar systems increase home values by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Sixteen Acres property significantly more attractive to potential buyers. We thoroughly discuss these scenarios during your consultation."
