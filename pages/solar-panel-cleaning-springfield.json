  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How often should I have my solar panels cleaned in Springfield?",
      "answer": "For Springfield's climate, we recommend professional cleaning 2-3 times per year—typically in spring (after pollen season), summer (after dust accumulation), and fall (after leaf debris). Properties near high-traffic roads, construction, or with heavy bird activity may benefit from quarterly cleaning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will cleaning really increase my solar energy production?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Studies show that dirty solar panels can lose 15-30% of their efficiency. In Springfield, we regularly document 20-25% production increases after professional cleaning, which directly translates to more energy savings and faster ROI on your solar investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I clean my solar panels myself?",
      "answer": "While possible, we don't recommend DIY solar panel cleaning. Improper techniques, harsh chemicals, or abrasive materials can scratch panels, void warranties, and create safety hazards. Our certified technicians have specialized equipment, proper insurance, and manufacturer-approved methods to clean safely and effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will rain clean my solar panels naturally?",
      "answer": "Rain helps, but doesn't replace professional cleaning. In Springfield, rain often leaves mineral deposits, and it can't remove stubborn bird droppings, tree sap, or baked-on pollen. Regular rain may actually create streaking that further reduces efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar panel cleaning take in Springfield?",
      "answer": "Most residential solar panel cleaning in Springfield takes 2-4 hours depending on array size, roof access, and panel condition. Commercial installations may take 4-8 hours. We work efficiently while maintaining the highest safety and quality standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer maintenance plans for Springfield solar systems?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our seasonal maintenance plans include scheduled cleanings, priority booking, performance monitoring, and discounted rates. Plans start at $450/year for residential systems and provide the consistent care Springfield solar panels need year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you damage my solar panels during cleaning?",
      "answer": "We're fully insured and bonded, and we've never damaged a panel in 12+ years of service. We use only manufacturer-approved cleaning methods and soft-bristle equipment. In the unlikely event of damage, our insurance provides complete coverage for repairs or replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you clean solar panels in winter in Springfield?",
      "answer": "Yes, with safety considerations. We clean panels year-round in Springfield, though winter scheduling depends on weather conditions. Snow removal from panels is particularly important as it blocks all energy production. We use safe techniques that won't damage panels or create ice hazards."
