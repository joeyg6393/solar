  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does solar installation cost in Brimfield, MA?",
      "answer": "Solar installation in Brimfield typically costs $16,800-$39,000 before benefits. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts state financing (15% up to $1,000), net costs range from $11,900-$27,900. Most Brimfield homes install 7-12 kW systems. With zero-down financing, monthly payments are usually lower than current electric bills, plus you earn net metering income."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are net meterings and how do they benefit Brimfield homeowners?",
      "answer": "Solar Renewable Energy Credits (net metering) are earned for every 1,000 kWh your system produces. In Massachusetts, you can sell these credits for additional income. Brimfield homeowners typically earn $2,000-$4,000 in net metering income over 10 years, adding significant value on top of electric bill savings. We handle all net metering enrollment and tracking."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much will I save with solar panels in Brimfield?",
      "answer": "Brimfield homeowners save an average of $1,900-$2,700 annually on electricity after installing solar panels. Combined with net metering income, total savings over 25 years typically exceed $60,000-$85,000. Massachusetts' net metering policy maximizes your savings by providing full retail credits for excess energy production."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my Brimfield home suitable for solar?",
      "answer": "Most Brimfield homes are excellent for solar! We can install on various roof types and also offer ground-mount systems ideal for Brimfield's rural properties. Your roof should have 15+ years remaining life, south to southwest orientation, and minimal shading. We'll evaluate your specific property during a free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does solar installation take in Brimfield?",
      "answer": "Physical installation takes 1-3 days for most Brimfield homes. The complete process from contract to activation averages 6-10 weeks, including design, Town of Brimfield permits, equipment delivery, installation, inspection, and utility interconnection. We manage the entire timeline and keep you updated throughout."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels work well in Massachusetts winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar panels are highly efficient in cold weather. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed to shed snow quickly, and the dark surface accelerates melting. We engineer all Brimfield installations to handle heavy Massachusetts snow loads, ice, and wind for reliable year-round performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties come with my Brimfield solar installation?",
      "answer": "Your system includes comprehensive protection: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels, 25-year inverter warranty, 10-year workmanship guarantee on installation, and lifetime roof waterproofing warranty. We also guarantee your system will produce the projected energy. All warranties transfer if you sell your Brimfield home."
