 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much does a solar roof cost in Springfield, MA?",
   "answer": "Solar roof installations in Springfield typically range from $45,000-$85,000 before benefits, depending on roof size and complexity. With the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART program benefits, your net cost can be reduced by $15,000-$25,000 or more. We offer free custom quotes and multiple financing options including $0 down solar loans."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar roof installation take in Springfield?",
   "answer": "Most Springfield solar roof installations take 5-10 days of actual installation work, depending on roof size and complexity. The complete process from consultation to activation typically takes 8-12 weeks, including design, permitting, installation, and utility interconnection. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your home."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the difference between Tesla Solar Roof and traditional solar panels?",
   "answer": "Tesla Solar Roof integrates photovoltaic cells directly into premium roofing shingles, replacing your entire roof with solar-generating materials. Traditional solar panels are mounted on top of your existing roof. Solar roofs offer superior aesthetics, integrated design, and premium roofing protection, while traditional panels are typically less expensive upfront."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will a solar roof work during Massachusetts winters?",
   "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs work year-round in Springfield, including winter months. While snow can temporarily reduce production, solar shingles are actually more efficient in cold temperatures. The steep pitch of most roofs allows snow to slide off quickly. Annual energy production accounts for seasonal variation, and net metering credits summer overproduction against winter usage."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties come with solar roof installation?",
   "answer": "Your Springfield solar roof installation includes Tesla's 25-year power output warranty on solar tiles, product warranties on all components, plus our 10-year workmanship guarantee covering installation labor. The premium roofing materials are designed to last 50+ years, far exceeding traditional roofing materials."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I add battery storage to my solar roof?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We offer Tesla Powerwall battery integration with all solar roof installations in Springfield. Battery storage allows you to use solar energy at night, provides backup power during outages, and maximizes your energy independence. Many Springfield homeowners choose to add 1-2 Powerwall batteries to their solar roof system."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much energy will my Springfield solar roof produce?",
   "answer": "Energy production depends on your roof's size, orientation, pitch, and shading. A typical Springfield home with a south-facing solar roof can generate 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, covering 80-100% of household electricity needs. We provide detailed production estimates during your free consultation based on your specific property and energy usage."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need to replace my roof before installing solar?",
   "answer": "No! Solar roof installation includes complete roof replacement as part of the system. If your Springfield home needs a new roof anyway, installing a Tesla Solar Roof makes excellent financial sense - you're getting both a premium new roof and a solar energy system in one investment, with substantial financing options available."
