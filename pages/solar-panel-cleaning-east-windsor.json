 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should solar panels be cleaned in East Windsor, Connecticut?",
   "answer": "East Windsor solar systems typically benefit from professional cleaning 2-3 times per year. We recommend spring cleaning (to remove winter debris and early pollen), mid-summer cleaning (for highway dust and pollution buildup), and fall cleaning (before winter weather). Properties near I-91, Route 5, or with significant tree coverage may need more frequent service due to increased environmental exposure. We'll assess your specific East Windsor location and provide a customized maintenance schedule."
  },
  {
   "question": "What efficiency gains can I expect from solar panel cleaning in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "East Windsor solar owners typically see 15-25% efficiency improvement after professional cleaning, with heavily soiled panels sometimes showing even greater gains. Highway dust, pollen from Connecticut River Valley vegetation, bird droppings, and environmental debris block sunlight and reduce energy production. Our professional cleaning restores panels to 95-100% of rated capacity, translating directly to increased daily energy production and lower utility bills. We document your specific performance improvements."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional solar panel cleaning worth the investment in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Professional cleaning provides immediate ROI for East Windsor solar owners. Dirty panels losing 20% efficiency cost the average homeowner $200-400 annually in lost energy production. Our $150-400 cleaning service restores that production, typically paying for itself within 2-4 months through increased energy savings. Additionally, regular professional maintenance extends panel lifespan, prevents warranty issues, and catches problems early, protecting your entire solar investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "Should I clean my own solar panels or hire professionals in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "Professional cleaning is strongly recommended for East Windsor rooftop systems. Key reasons: (1) Rooftop work requires proper safety equipment and training to prevent falls and injuries, (2) Incorrect cleaning methods or products can void warranties and permanently damage panels, (3) Professional technicians identify potential problems during inspection that homeowners miss, and (4) We carry full liability insurance protecting your property. The modest cost of professional service far outweighs the safety risks and potential damage from DIY cleaning."
  },
  {
   "question": "What cleaning products and techniques do you use in East Windsor?",
   "answer": "We use only manufacturer-approved methods for East Windsor solar installations: deionized water (prevents mineral deposits and water spots), biodegradable eco-friendly cleaning solutions safe for Connecticut environment and landscaping, and specialized soft brushes designed specifically for solar panels. We never use pressure washers (which can force water under seals), abrasive scrubbers (which create micro-scratches), or harsh chemicals (which damage anti-reflective coatings). Our methods are proven safe, effective, and warranty-compliant."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you provide solar panel cleaning for East Windsor businesses?",
   "answer": "Yes! We service both residential and commercial solar installations throughout East Windsor and Hartford County. Our experience includes large commercial rooftop arrays, ground-mount systems, solar carports, warehouse installations, and multi-building facilities. We offer flexible scheduling around your business operations, fleet service for companies with multiple East Windsor locations, and customized maintenance contracts tailored to commercial needs and budgets."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will professional solar panel cleaning void my warranty?",
   "answer": "No - professional cleaning using proper methods maintains and protects your warranty coverage. We use only manufacturer-approved cleaning techniques and products that fully comply with warranty requirements. In fact, many solar panel warranties specifically require regular maintenance, and failure to properly maintain your system could potentially void warranty coverage. We provide detailed service documentation that demonstrates proper maintenance compliance for warranty purposes."
  },
  {
   "question": "What other issues do you check during East Windsor solar panel cleaning?",
   "answer": "Our East Windsor cleaning service includes a comprehensive system inspection at no additional charge. We check for: physical damage or micro-cracks in panels, loose or corroded mounting hardware and brackets, compromised weatherproof seals, debris accumulation around the array, inverter performance issues and error codes, electrical wiring connections and conduit condition, and vegetation or shading problems. We document all findings with detailed photographs and provide recommendations, helping you maintain optimal system performance and avoid expensive future repairs."
