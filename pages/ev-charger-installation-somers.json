 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How long does EV charger installation take in Somers?",
   "answer": "Most EV charger installations in Somers are completed in 3-5 hours for standard installations. If your electrical panel requires upgrading to support the charger, the project may take 6-8 hours or be scheduled across two visits. We'll provide an accurate timeline during your free in-home consultation after assessing your specific electrical system and installation requirements."
  },
  {
   "question": "What EV charger is best for Connecticut weather?",
   "answer": "All the major chargers we install—Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox, and Grizzl-E—are designed to withstand extreme temperatures, snow, ice, and rain. For outdoor installations in Somers, we particularly recommend the Grizzl-E for its exceptional durability in harsh weather, or the ChargePoint Home Flex which is NEMA 4 rated for outdoor use. We'll recommend the best option based on your installation location and budget."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need a permit to install an EV charger in Somers?",
   "answer": "Yes, EV charger installations in Somers require an electrical permit from the Town of Somers Building Department. This is a standard requirement to ensure all electrical work meets Connecticut electrical code and safety standards. We handle all permit applications on your behalf and coordinate required inspections, so you don't need to worry about the paperwork. Permit fees are typically included in our installation quotes."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I install an EV charger if I have an older home in Somers?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Many older homes in Somers have 100-amp electrical panels that may need upgrading to support Level 2 EV charging. We routinely upgrade electrical panels from 100-amp to 200-amp service as part of EV charger installations. This not only supports your EV charger but also future-proofs your home for other electrical needs. During your free consultation, we'll assess your current electrical system and provide recommendations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does it cost to charge an EV at home in Somers?",
   "answer": "Charging costs in Somers depend on Eversource electricity rates and your vehicle's battery size. On average, it costs about $8-12 to fully charge most EVs at home (versus $15-25 at public charging stations). If you pair your EV charger with a solar panel system, you can charge with solar energy at minimal cost. Over a year, most Somers homeowners save $800-1,500 by charging at home versus using public chargers."
  },
  {
   "question": "Which EV charger brands do you install in Somers?",
   "answer": "We install all major EV charger brands including Tesla Wall Connector (for Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles), ChargePoint Home Flex, JuiceBox (all models), Grizzl-E, Emporia, Wallbox Pulsar Plus, and others. We're brand-agnostic and will recommend the best charger based on your specific vehicle, desired features (like Wi-Fi connectivity), budget, and whether you want hardwired or plug-in installation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I install an EV charger and solar panels at the same time in Somers?",
   "answer": "Yes, and it's actually ideal! Installing solar panels and an EV charger together is the ultimate combination for energy independence and savings. You'll power your home and vehicle with clean, renewable energy generated right on your Somers property. We specialize in integrated solar and EV charging installations and can design a complete system that meets all your needs. Plus, you'll maximize flexible financings and Connecticut benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 charging?",
   "answer": "Level 1 charging uses a standard 120V household outlet and provides about 3-5 miles of range per hour—fine for plug-in hybrids but very slow for full EVs. Level 2 charging uses a 240V circuit (like your dryer) and provides 25-50 miles of range per hour, charging most EVs fully overnight in 4-8 hours. For Somers homeowners with electric vehicles, we always recommend Level 2 charging for convenience and practicality."
