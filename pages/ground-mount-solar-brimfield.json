 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much space is needed for ground-mount solar in Brimfield?",
   "answer": "A typical residential ground-mount system (6-12 kW) in Brimfield requires 600-2,400 square feet of land. The exact footprint depends on your energy needs and system capacity. Our Brimfield team conducts a thorough site assessment to determine the optimal configuration for your property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is ground-mount solar suitable for Brimfield winters?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are specifically engineered for Massachusetts winters. They're designed to handle snow loads common in Brimfield and western Massachusetts. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing much easier than rooftop systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's the cost for ground-mount solar in Brimfield?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Brimfield typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Massachusetts SMART incentive, net investment is substantially lower. Most Brimfield homeowners see payback within 7-10 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Brimfield?",
   "answer": "Yes, ground-mount installations in Brimfield require building permits and must comply with local zoning including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Brimfield and Hampden County, ensuring your system meets all Massachusetts codes and regulations."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does installation take in Brimfield?",
   "answer": "Complete ground-mount solar installation in Brimfield typically takes 8-12 weeks from initial consultation to system activation. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and inspections (1-2 weeks)."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
   "answer": "Yes! Expandability is a major advantage of ground-mount solar. We design systems with future growth potential, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase. This flexibility is much greater than rooftop systems, ideal for growing Brimfield families and farms."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require?",
   "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance - typically annual inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Brimfield customers find rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow."
