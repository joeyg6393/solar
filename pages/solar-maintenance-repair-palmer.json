 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should Palmer solar systems be professionally maintained?",
   "answer": "We recommend at least annual professional maintenance for Palmer solar installations. Systems in areas with heavy tree coverage or near industrial zones may benefit from biannual service. Spring maintenance (after winter and during pollen season) and fall service (preparing for winter) provide optimal year-round performance. Regular maintenance can improve energy production by 20-30% compared to unmaintained systems."
  },
  {
   "question": "What causes solar panels to lose efficiency in Palmer?",
   "answer": "Common efficiency killers in Palmer include dirt and pollen accumulation, bird droppings, tree sap, snow and ice residue, shading from growing trees, inverter issues, loose electrical connections, and micro-cracks from thermal cycling. Our maintenance service addresses all these issues, restoring and maintaining peak performance for your Three Rivers area solar system."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is professional solar panel cleaning necessary?",
   "answer": "Yes! While rain provides some cleaning, it doesn't remove stubborn contaminants like pollen, bird droppings, or tree sap that significantly reduce efficiency. Professional cleaning in Palmer can restore 15-30% lost efficiency. We use proper equipment, safety gear, and techniques that protect your panels while thoroughly cleaning them - safer and more effective than DIY attempts."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer emergency solar repair in Palmer?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! We provide 24/7 emergency solar repair service for critical issues including complete system shutdown, electrical hazards, storm damage, or inverter failures. Our Palmer-area emergency team typically responds within 4 hours during business hours and 6-8 hours for after-hours calls. Most emergencies are resolved on the first visit."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you service solar panels I didn't purchase from you?",
   "answer": "Yes! We maintain and repair all brands and types of solar systems throughout Palmer, regardless of the original installer. Our technicians are certified to work on all major solar equipment brands and provide warranty-compliant service. We treat every system with professional care whether we installed it or not."
  },
  {
   "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance contract?",
   "answer": "Our Palmer annual maintenance contracts include: two comprehensive service visits (spring and fall), thorough panel cleaning, complete system inspection, inverter diagnostics, electrical testing, performance reports, priority emergency scheduling, and 15% discount on any needed repairs. It's the most cost-effective way to protect your solar investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much do solar panel repairs cost in Palmer?",
   "answer": "Repair costs vary depending on the issue. Simple repairs like cleaning connections or resetting systems may be $150-300. Inverter repairs range from $500-2,000. Full inverter replacement costs $1,500-4,000 depending on size. Individual panel replacement is $300-600 per panel. We provide detailed estimates before starting any work, and many repairs are covered under manufacturer warranties."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will maintenance affect my solar panel warranty?",
   "answer": "Professional maintenance protects your warranty - it doesn't void it. In fact, many solar panel warranties require proof of regular professional maintenance to remain valid. We provide detailed service documentation that meets all manufacturer warranty requirements, ensuring your coverage is protected throughout the warranty period."
