  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land is needed for ground-mount solar in Somers?",
      "answer": "A typical residential ground-mount solar system (8-12 kW) in Somers requires 800-2,400 square feet of land. The exact footprint depends on your energy needs and desired system capacity. Our Somers team performs a comprehensive site analysis to determine the optimal layout for your property's specific characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems suitable for Somers' winter weather?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our ground-mount systems are specifically engineered for Connecticut winters. They're designed to handle snow loads common in Somers and Tolland County. The angled panels naturally shed snow, and ground-level access makes clearing much easier than rooftop systems. Many Somers customers find their ground-mount systems perform excellently year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical cost for ground-mount solar in Somers?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount solar in Somers typically costs $2.50-$3.50 per watt before benefits. A standard 10 kW system ranges from $25,000-$35,000. After the competitive pricing and Connecticut benefits, net investment is substantially lower. Many Somers homeowners achieve full payback within 7-10 years. We provide detailed cost estimates during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for ground-mount solar in Somers?",
      "answer": "Yes, ground-mount solar installations in Somers require building permits and must comply with local zoning regulations including setback requirements. Our team handles all permitting with the Town of Somers and Tolland County, ensuring your system meets all codes and regulations. We manage this entire process so you don't have to."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does ground-mount solar installation take in Somers?",
      "answer": "From initial consultation to system activation, most ground-mount solar projects in Somers take 8-12 weeks. This includes design (1-2 weeks), permitting (3-5 weeks), equipment procurement (2-3 weeks), installation (3-5 days), and final inspections (1-2 weeks). Weather and permit processing can affect timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add more panels to my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! One of the biggest advantages of ground-mount solar is expandability. We design systems with future growth in mind, making it easy to add panels as your energy needs increase or budget allows. This flexibility is much greater than with rooftop systems, making ground-mount ideal for growing Somers families and businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does ground-mount solar require in Somers?",
      "answer": "Ground-mount systems require minimal maintenance. We recommend annual professional inspections and occasional cleaning (2-4 times yearly). The ground-level access makes maintenance much easier than rooftop systems. Most Somers customers find that rain naturally cleans panels, with occasional clearing of leaves or snow as needed."
