 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much money will I save with solar panels in Westfield?",
   "answer": "Westfield homeowners typically save 50-70% on their electricity bills with solar panels. The average Westfield household saves $1,200-$2,000 per year on electricity costs. Over the 25+ year lifespan of your solar system, that translates to $30,000-$50,000 in total savings. With Westfield Gas & Electric's net metering and Massachusetts net metering programs, your savings can be even greater."
  },
  {
   "question": "What solar financing options are available for Westfield residents?",
   "answer": "Westfield homeowners benefit from excellent solar benefits including: flexible financing options, Massachusetts Solar Renewable Energy Credits (net metering) generating $1,000-$3,000 annually, increased property value, professional service on equipment, and full retail rate net metering credits. We help you maximize every available incentive to reduce your investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar panel installation take in Westfield?",
   "answer": "The physical installation on your Westfield home typically takes 1-3 days. The entire process from contract to system activation averages 6-10 weeks, including custom design, City of Westfield permitting, equipment delivery, and Westfield Gas & Electric interconnection approval. We manage all steps and keep you informed throughout."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do solar panels work effectively during Westfield winters?",
   "answer": "Yes! Solar panels operate more efficiently in cold temperatures. While winter days are shorter in Westfield, modern solar technology still generates substantial energy even on overcast days. Snow accumulation on tilted panels is minimal and melts quickly in Westfield. Western Massachusetts receives excellent solar irradiance year-round, making Westfield ideal for solar energy."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels increase my Westfield home's value?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Research shows solar panels increase home values by $15,000-$25,000 on average in Massachusetts. Westfield homes with solar installations sell faster and command premium prices compared to comparable homes without solar. Solar is viewed as a valuable upgrade that appeals to buyers seeking lower utility costs and environmental benefits."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if my Westfield roof needs replacement?",
   "answer": "We thoroughly assess your roof during the free consultation. If your Westfield home's roof is approaching end-of-life, we recommend replacement before solar installation. We can coordinate with trusted local Westfield roofers or handle roofing ourselves. The good news is solar panels actually protect and extend your roof's lifespan by shielding it from UV rays and weather."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can I monitor my solar system's performance?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Every system includes real-time monitoring through user-friendly smartphone apps. You can track energy production, consumption, and savings from anywhere. The system alerts you to any issues, and we remotely monitor all Westfield installations to ensure optimal performance. Most homeowners love checking their solar production daily!"
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens when my Westfield solar system produces excess energy?",
   "answer": "Massachusetts offers excellent net metering policies. When your Westfield solar panels produce more electricity than you consume, the excess flows to the grid and you receive full retail rate credits on your Westfield Gas & Electric bill. These credits roll forward month-to-month, allowing summer overproduction to offset winter usage. Every kilowatt-hour has full value."
