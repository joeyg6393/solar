    {
      "question": "What is the cost of solar roof installation in Sixteen Acres, Springfield MA?",
      "answer": "Solar roof installation in Sixteen Acres typically ranges from $42,000-$84,000 before benefits, depending on roof size and system capacity. With the competitive pricing, you'll save $10,920-$21,840 immediately. Massachusetts SMART program provides substantial additional benefits. Most Sixteen Acres homeowners achieve complete payback in 10-14 years through annual electricity savings averaging $2,500-$4,500."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do solar roofs last in Massachusetts weather?",
      "answer": "Our solar roofs are engineered for Massachusetts' demanding climate. Solar shingles last 25-30+ years with minimal maintenance, far outlasting traditional asphalt shingles (15-20 years). They're three times stronger than standard roofing with Class A fire rating and superior resistance to hail, wind, heavy snow, and temperature extremes common in Springfield."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a solar roof work during Sixteen Acres' snowy winters?",
      "answer": "Yes! Solar roofs perform well year-round in Sixteen Acres. Dark solar shingles absorb heat and help snow melt faster than traditional roofing. While production is lower during short winter days, annual production is optimized for Massachusetts' climate. Our systems are designed to handle heavy snow loads typical of Springfield winters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I afford a solar roof with financing options?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We offer $0 down solar loans, home equity financing, and Massachusetts-specific programs for Sixteen Acres homeowners. With the competitive pricing, SMART benefits, and immediate electricity savings, most customers achieve positive cash flow from day one. Monthly loan payments are typically less than current electricity bills."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much value does a solar roof add to my Sixteen Acres home?",
      "answer": "Studies show solar installations increase home values by $20,000-$40,000 on average in Massachusetts. Solar roofs add even more because they combine a brand-new roof with energy generation. Sixteen Acres homes with solar sell faster and command premium prices, especially as energy costs continue rising."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required for solar roof installation in Sixteen Acres?",
      "answer": "Solar roof installations in Sixteen Acres require building permits from Springfield building department and electrical permits. We handle all permitting, inspections, and utility interconnection agreements with Eversource. Our team has extensive experience with Springfield requirements, ensuring smooth approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add battery storage to my Sixteen Acres solar roof?",
      "answer": "Yes! We recommend pairing solar roofs with battery storage systems like Tesla Powerwall for maximum energy independence. Battery backup stores excess solar production for use at night or during power outages - especially valuable during Massachusetts winter storms. We design integrated solar roof + battery systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do solar roofs compare to traditional solar panels?",
      "answer": "Solar roofs offer superior aesthetics (integrated vs. mounted), complete roof replacement, and often better warranties. They're ideal if your Sixteen Acres home needs a new roof anyway, you value curb appeal, or want cutting-edge technology. Traditional panels are more economical if your roof is in good condition. We'll help you choose during your free consultation."
