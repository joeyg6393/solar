  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options can Enfield homeowners access in 2024?",
      "answer": "Enfield residents qualify for the available savings, which applies to the full system cost including installation. Connecticut also offers the SMART program providing solar renewable energy credits, net metering that credits excess solar production to your utility account, and potential local rebates. Our consultation identifies all benefits specific to your Enfield property to maximize savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of solar financing are available in Enfield, CT?",
      "answer": "Enfield homeowners can choose from several financing options: solar loans (5-25 year terms with competitive rates), solar leases (no upfront cost with fixed monthly payments), and power purchase agreements (pay only for electricity produced). We also offer zero-down solar loans for qualified applicants. During your free consultation, we analyze which option delivers the best financial outcome for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money can I save by going solar in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on your electricity usage, system size, and financing choice, but typical Enfield homeowners reduce their electric bills by 60-95%. Over 25 years, total savings usually range from $28,000 to $65,000. The competitive pricing immediately cuts thousands from your installation cost. We provide precise savings projections based on your actual Enfield utility rates during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What credit score do I need for solar financing in Enfield?",
      "answer": "While credit scores of 650 or higher typically secure the best loan rates, we work with multiple financing partners who serve various credit profiles. Even with lower credit scores, solar lease and PPA options may be available that require minimal or no credit check. During consultation, we'll review your credit situation confidentially and identify suitable financing solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get solar financing approved in Enfield?",
      "answer": "The timeline from consultation to financing approval typically takes 1-3 weeks. We schedule free consultations within 24 hours, deliver financial analysis within 3-5 business days, and most financing applications receive approval within 5-7 business days. Once approved, solar installation in Enfield usually begins within 4-8 weeks depending on permitting and weather conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there really no cost for solar financing consultation in Enfield?",
      "answer": "Correct! Our Enfield solar financing consultation is completely free with absolutely no obligation to proceed. We provide comprehensive property assessments, energy audits, financial projections, and incentive research at no charge. We believe in transparent education so Enfield homeowners can make confident decisions. You'll only move forward if the numbers make financial sense for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to my solar system if I move from my Enfield home?",
      "answer": "If you own your system through your financing, you can pay off the loan at closing, transfer the loan to the buyer (with lender approval), or include the loan payoff in your sale price. Studies show solar systems increase home values by more than the remaining loan balance, making your Enfield home more attractive to buyers. We cover these scenarios in detail during consultation."
