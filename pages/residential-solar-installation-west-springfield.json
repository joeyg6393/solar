    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels work during West Springfield winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Solar panels operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures. While winter days are shorter in West Springfield, modern solar technology still produces significant energy even on cloudy days. Snow melts quickly on tilted panels. West Springfield's excellent solar irradiance makes it ideal for year-round solar production."

      "answer": "Yes! Studies show solar panels increase home values by $15,000-$25,000 on average in Massachusetts. West Springfield homes with solar installations sell faster and at premium prices compared to similar non-solar homes. Solar is a major value-add that attracts environmentally conscious buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my West Springfield roof needs replacement?",
      "answer": "We conduct a thorough roof assessment during your free consultation. If your West Springfield home's roof is nearing end-of-life, we recommend replacement before solar installation. We can coordinate with trusted local roofers or handle roofing ourselves. Solar panels actually protect and extend roof lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I monitor my solar system's performance?",
      "answer": "Every installation includes real-time monitoring through intuitive smartphone apps. You can track energy production, consumption, and savings from anywhere. The system alerts you to any issues, and we remotely monitor all West Springfield installations to ensure peak performance. Most homeowners check production daily!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when I produce more energy than I use in West Springfield?",
      "answer": "Massachusetts has excellent net metering policies. When your West Springfield solar system generates more electricity than you consume, the surplus is fed to the grid and you receive full retail rate credits on your Eversource bill. Credits roll over month-to-month, so summer overproduction offsets winter usage."
