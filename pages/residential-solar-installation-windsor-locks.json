 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much do solar panels cost for a home in Windsor Locks, CT?",
   "answer": "The typical residential solar installation in Windsor Locks costs between $15,000-$35,000 before benefits, depending on system size. After the competitive pricing, net costs range from $11,000-$26,000. Most Windsor Locks homeowners install 6-10 kW systems. With zero-down financing options, monthly payments are often lower than current electric bills, providing immediate savings."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much can I save on electricity with solar panels in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "Windsor Locks homeowners typically save $1,200-$2,400 annually on electricity costs after installing solar panels. Over 25 years, total savings often exceed $40,000-$60,000 when accounting for rising utility rates. Connecticut's net metering policy provides additional value by crediting you for excess energy your system produces."
  },
  {
   "question": "Does my Windsor Locks roof qualify for solar panel installation?",
   "answer": "Most Windsor Locks homes are excellent candidates for solar! We can install on asphalt shingle, metal, tile, and flat roofs. Your roof should have 15+ years of remaining life, adequate south/southwest exposure, and minimal shading. During our free assessment, we evaluate your specific property and can recommend ground-mount alternatives if rooftop installation isn't ideal."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does solar panel installation take in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "The physical installation typically takes 1-3 days for most Windsor Locks homes. The complete process from signing to activation averages 4-8 weeks, which includes design, permitting with Hartford County, equipment procurement, installation, and utility interconnection. We manage the entire timeline and keep you informed at every step."
  },
  {
   "question": "What happens to my solar panels during Connecticut winters?",
   "answer": "Solar panels actually perform well in Connecticut's cold, sunny winter days. While snow may temporarily cover panels, they're designed with smooth surfaces that allow snow to slide off, and dark panels absorb heat to accelerate melting. We design all Windsor Locks installations to withstand snow loads and ensure optimal year-round performance."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels increase my Windsor Locks home value?",
   "answer": "Yes! Studies show solar panels increase home values by an average of 4.1%, according to Zillow. For the average Windsor Locks home, this translates to approximately $15,000-$25,000 in added value. Solar homes also sell faster than non-solar homes, making it a smart investment for current savings and future resale value."
  },
  {
   "question": "What warranties come with my Windsor Locks solar installation?",
   "answer": "You receive comprehensive protection: 25-year performance warranty on solar panels, 25-year warranty on inverters, 10-year workmanship guarantee on our installation, and lifetime roof waterproofing warranty. We also provide production guarantees ensuring your system performs as designed. All warranties are fully transferable to future homeowners."
