  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What solar financing options are available to Suffield, CT homeowners?",
      "answer": "Suffield residents can access the federal solar incentive (deduct of installation cost from financing), Connecticut solar benefit programs, Solar Renewable Energy Credit (net metering) trading opportunities, net metering benefits with Eversource, and property assessment exemptions for solar installations. Combined, these programs significantly reduce the effective cost of going solar. We'll calculate exactly how much you qualify for during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I save with solar in Suffield?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on system size, energy usage, and financing method, but typical Suffield homeowners save $25,000-$52,000 over 25 years after accounting for all benefits and reduced utility bills. With current programs, payback periods generally range from 7-11 years, after which you enjoy essentially free electricity for 15-20+ additional years. Connecticut's relatively high electricity rates make solar particularly attractive. We'll provide exact savings projections customized to your Suffield property during the consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar with zero money down in Suffield?",
      "answer": "Yes! We work with multiple lending partners offering $0-down solar loans for qualified Suffield homeowners. Many clients find their monthly loan payment is actually lower than their previous electric bill, creating immediate positive cash flow and savings from day one. Interest rates typically range from 2.99%-6.99% depending on credit profile and loan term. We'll compare several zero-down options during your free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy or lease solar panels in Suffield?",
      "answer": "For most Suffield homeowners, purchasing solar (via cash or loan) delivers superior long-term financial value. When you own the system, you receive the full competitive pricing, all Connecticut benefits, net metering income, and maximize lifetime savings - typically 25-35% more than leasing over 25 years. However, leasing can work for those who prefer predictable monthly costs with no maintenance responsibility. We'll model both scenarios with specific numbers for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the payback period for solar in Suffield, Connecticut?",
      "answer": "With current federal and Connecticut benefits combined with Suffield's utility rates (among Connecticut's highest), most homeowners achieve solar payback in 7-11 years. After payback, you enjoy free electricity for the remaining 15-20+ years of the system's warrantied life, dramatically multiplying your total savings. Factors affecting payback include system size, financing method, energy usage, roof orientation, and financing options. Our detailed analysis will show your specific payback timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Connecticut's solar financing options work for Suffield homeowners?",
      "answer": "Connecticut offers several solar benefit programs including net metering (Solar Renewable Energy Credit) trading, which allows you to earn additional income by selling the environmental attributes of your solar production. Connecticut also has strong net metering policies allowing you to bank excess solar production as credits. Combined with the flexible financing, these programs make solar highly affordable. We'll explain all Connecticut-specific programs during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar panels increase my property costs in Suffield?",
      "answer": "Connecticut law provides property assessment exemptions for solar installations in most municipalities. While solar typically increases your Suffield home's value by 4-6%, the solar addition itself is often exempt from property assessments. This is one of several Connecticut benefits that make solar an excellent investment - your home value increases without necessarily raising your cost bill. We'll confirm Suffield's specific policy during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started with solar financing consultation in Suffield?",
      "answer": "Getting started is easy! Simply call us at (413) 555-0100 or submit a consultation request on our website. We'll schedule a convenient time for a free meeting at your Suffield home, our office, or virtually. Bring 12 months of utility bills if available.
