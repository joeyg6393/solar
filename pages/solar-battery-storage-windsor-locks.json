For whole-home backup in Windsor Locks, we typically recommend 2-3 Powerwalls depending on your home's size and energy usage. We'll design a system that provides the backup protection your Windsor Locks family needs."

Whether you have a recent solar array or an older system, we can integrate modern battery storage. Tesla Powerwall and other batteries work with virtually all solar panel brands and inverter types. We'll assess your current Windsor Locks system and design the perfect battery integration."

We'll calculate specific savings for your Windsor Locks home's usage patterns."
