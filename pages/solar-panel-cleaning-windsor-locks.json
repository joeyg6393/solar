 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should I have my solar panels cleaned in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "Most Windsor Locks solar systems benefit from professional cleaning 2-3 times per year. We recommend cleaning in early spring (to remove winter salt and pollen), mid-summer (for dust and pollution buildup), and fall (before winter weather). Properties near Bradley International Airport or major roads may require more frequent cleaning due to increased particulate matter. We'll assess your specific location and provide a customized maintenance schedule."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will cleaning my solar panels really increase efficiency?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Studies show that dirty solar panels can lose 15-25% of their efficiency. In Windsor Locks, seasonal pollen, road dust, bird droppings, and environmental debris accumulate on panels, blocking sunlight and reducing energy production. Our professional cleaning typically restores panels to 95-100% of their rated capacity, translating to significant energy savings and faster ROI on your solar investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is it safe to clean solar panels myself, or should I hire professionals?",
   "answer": "While homeowners can clean ground-level panels safely, rooftop systems present significant safety risks. Professional cleaning is strongly recommended for Windsor Locks residents because: (1) Rooftop work requires proper safety equipment and training, (2) Incorrect cleaning methods or harsh chemicals can void warranties and damage panels, (3) Our technicians identify potential issues during inspection, and (4) We have liability insurance protecting your property. Professional cleaning is a small investment that protects your much larger solar investment."
  },
  {
   "question": "What cleaning methods and products do you use on solar panels?",
   "answer": "We use only manufacturer-approved cleaning methods for Windsor Locks solar systems. Our process includes deionized water (which prevents mineral deposits), biodegradable eco-friendly solutions safe for your home and landscaping, and soft-brush tools specifically designed for solar panels that won't cause micro-scratches. We never use pressure washers, abrasive materials, or harsh chemicals that could damage anti-reflective coatings or void your warranty."
  },
  {
   "question": "How much does solar panel cleaning cost in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "Residential solar panel cleaning in Windsor Locks typically costs $150-$400 depending on system size (number of panels), roof pitch and accessibility, and current panel condition. Commercial systems range from $400-$1,200. We offer discounted seasonal maintenance packages (2-3 cleanings per year) that provide the best value and keep your system performing optimally. Contact us for a free, no-obligation quote customized to your Windsor Locks property."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you provide service to commercial solar installations in Windsor Locks?",
   "answer": "Yes! We service both residential and commercial solar installations throughout Windsor Locks and Hartford County. Our team has experience with large ground-mount arrays, commercial rooftop systems, solar carports, and multi-building installations. We can work around your business hours, provide fleet service for multiple locations, and create customized maintenance contracts for Windsor Locks businesses, warehouses, and industrial facilities."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will cleaning void my solar panel warranty?",
   "answer": "No - when done correctly by professionals, cleaning maintains rather than voids your warranty. We use only manufacturer-approved cleaning methods and products. In fact, most solar panel warranties require regular maintenance, and neglecting to clean your panels could potentially void warranty coverage. We provide documentation of our service that demonstrates proper maintenance for warranty purposes."
  },
  {
   "question": "What else do you check during a solar panel cleaning service?",
   "answer": "Our Windsor Locks solar cleaning service includes a comprehensive inspection at no additional charge. We check for: micro-cracks or physical damage to panels, loose or corroded mounting hardware, damaged weather seals, vegetation or debris buildup around the array, inverter error codes or performance issues, wiring concerns, and potential shading problems from tree growth. If we identify any issues, we'll document them with photos and provide recommendations, helping you avoid costly repairs down the road."
