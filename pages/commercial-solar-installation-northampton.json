 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How much can my Northampton business save with commercial solar?",
   "answer": "Most Northampton businesses reduce their electricity costs by 60-70% immediately after installation. Over 25 years, a typical commercial solar system saves $500,000 to over $1 million depending on system size and energy usage. With Massachusetts' net metering, the competitive pricing, SMART benefits, and accelerated depreciation, the financial benefits are substantial. We provide a free detailed ROI analysis specific to your business."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for commercial solar in Massachusetts?",
   "answer": "Massachusetts offers some of the nation's best solar benefits: federal Investment financing (financing), SMART program payments for energy production, 5-year accelerated depreciation (MACRS), and net metering credits. Combined, these benefits can reduce your solar investment by 50% or more in the first year. Our team helps you maximize every available incentive."
  },
  {
   "question": "How long does commercial solar installation take in Northampton?",
   "answer": "From contract signing to system activation, most commercial solar projects in Northampton take 2-4 months. This includes design (2-3 weeks), permitting with the City of Northampton (4-6 weeks), installation (1-3 weeks depending on size), and utility approval (2-4 weeks). We manage the entire process and keep your business informed at every step."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will solar panels work during Northampton's winters?",
   "answer": "Yes! Solar panels actually perform better in cold temperatures. While shorter winter days mean less production, modern panels are highly efficient and can generate significant power even on cloudy days. Snow typically slides off tilted panels quickly, and any reduction in winter production is offset by excellent spring and summer performance. Your system is designed to produce optimal energy year-round in New England's climate."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can we add battery storage to our commercial solar system?",
   "answer": "Absolutely! Battery storage is increasingly popular for Northampton businesses wanting backup power, demand charge reduction, and complete energy independence. We install commercial-grade battery systems that can power critical operations during outages and help you avoid expensive peak demand charges. Battery storage qualifies for the same competitive pricing as solar panels."
  },
  {
   "question": "What maintenance do commercial solar systems require?",
   "answer": "Commercial solar systems require minimal maintenance. Panels are self-cleaning in most weather conditions, and we include real-time monitoring to immediately alert us to any performance issues. We recommend annual inspections to check electrical connections and ensure optimal performance. Most maintenance is covered under our 10-year workmanship warranty and manufacturer warranties cover equipment for 25 years."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do I know if my Northampton building is suitable for solar?",
   "answer": "Most commercial buildings in Northampton are excellent candidates for solar! We evaluate your roof age and condition, available space, shading, structural capacity, and electrical system during our free assessment. If your roof isn't suitable, we can explore ground-mount options, carport solar structures, or recommend roof improvements. Buildings with south, southwest, or west-facing roof space typically work best."
  },
  {
   "question": "What financing options are available for commercial solar?",
   "answer": "We offer multiple financing options for Northampton businesses: cash purchase (maximum savings and quickest ROI), commercial solar loans (own the system and keep all benefits with zero down payment), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs - pay only for the power with no upfront cost), and leasing options. Each has different tax implications and benefits. We help you choose the best option for your business's financial situation."
