  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of EV charger installation in East Windsor, CT?",
      "answer": "EV charger installation in East Windsor typically costs between $800-$2,500. This includes the charging unit, professional installation, electrical work, permit fees, and testing. Costs vary based on distance from your electrical panel, whether panel upgrades are needed, and which charger model you choose. The federal government offers a financing covering 30% of costs up to $1,000, significantly reducing your out-of-pocket expense. We provide free consultations with detailed, transparent pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take for an EV charger in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "Standard EV charger installations in East Windsor take 3-5 hours to complete. If your electrical panel requires upgrading, the project may take 6-8 hours or be scheduled across two visits. From initial consultation to final activation, most of our East Windsor customers are charging their vehicles within 3-7 business days. We'll provide an accurate timeline after assessing your home during the free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to upgrade my electrical panel for an EV charger?",
      "answer": "Many homes in East Windsor have 100-amp or 150-amp electrical panels. Level 2 EV chargers typically require a dedicated 40-60 amp circuit. If your panel is near capacity or outdated, we may recommend upgrading to a 200-amp panel. This not only supports your EV charger but also future-proofs your home for additional electrical needs like solar panels, heat pumps, or home additions. Our free assessment will determine exactly what's needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which EV charger brand should I choose for my East Windsor home?",
      "answer": "The best EV charger depends on your vehicle, budget, and preferred features. Tesla Wall Connector is ideal for Tesla owners but also charges other EVs. ChargePoint Home Flex offers excellent reliability and smart features. JuiceBox provides great value with Wi-Fi connectivity. Grizzl-E is exceptionally durable for outdoor installations in Connecticut weather. During your consultation, we'll recommend the perfect charger based on your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are EV chargers compatible with all electric vehicles?",
      "answer": "Yes! All electric vehicles sold in North America use the standard J1772 connector for Level 2 charging, making them compatible with all home EV chargers. Tesla vehicles include a J1772 adapter, and Tesla Wall Connectors can charge non-Tesla vehicles with an adapter. Whether you drive a Tesla, Chevrolet Bolt, Ford F-150 Lightning, Nissan Leaf, or any other EV, we'll ensure your charger works perfectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install an outdoor EV charger in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We install both indoor garage chargers and outdoor driveway/carport chargers throughout East Windsor. Outdoor installations use weather-resistant chargers specifically rated to withstand Connecticut's climate, including snow, ice, rain, and temperature extremes. We'll help determine the best location based on where you park, your electrical panel location, and convenience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are needed for EV charger installation in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "EV charger installations in East Windsor require an electrical permit from the Town of East Windsor Building Department. We handle all permit applications, submit required documentation, and coordinate electrical inspections on your behalf. Our installations always meet or exceed Connecticut electrical code (NEC) requirements, ensuring they pass inspection on the first visit. Permit costs are included in our installation quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I power my EV charger with solar panels in East Windsor?",
      "answer": "Yes, and it's one of the smartest energy decisions you can make! By installing solar panels on your East Windsor home, you can charge your electric vehicle with clean, renewable energy at minimal cost. We specialize in integrated solar and EV charging installations, designing systems that power both your home and vehicle. This combination maximizes flexible benefits, reduces your carbon footprint, and provides maximum long-term savings."
