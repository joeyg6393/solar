  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much land is needed for ground-mount solar in Agawam?",
      "answer": "Most Agawam residential systems require approximately 3,000-4,000 square feet of unshaded land for a typical 10kW installation. This is about the size of a large backyard. Our free site assessment will determine the optimal system size for your specific Agawam property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ground-mount systems worth it in Agawam?",
      "answer": "Yes! While ground-mount systems cost slightly more initially, they produce 10-25% more energy due to optimal positioning and better cooling. For Agawam properties with roof challenges or those wanting maximum production, ground-mount systems offer superior long-term value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are needed in Agawam for ground-mount solar?",
      "answer": "Agawam ground-mount installations require building permits from the Town Building Department and electrical permits. Depending on system size and location, zoning approval may be needed. We handle all permitting and ensure compliance with Agawam's regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take in Agawam?",
      "answer": "After permit approval, most residential ground-mount installations in Agawam take 3-5 days. The permitting process typically requires 4-8 weeks. We provide a complete timeline during consultation and keep you updated throughout your Agawam solar project."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do ground-mount systems work in Agawam winters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our systems are engineered for New England weather, including Agawam's snow and ice. The elevated design allows snow to slide off, and ground access makes snow removal easy when needed. Ground-mount systems often outperform rooftop installations in winter."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options are available for Agawam solar?",
      "answer": "Agawam residents qualify for the competitive pricing, Massachusetts SMART program (10-20 years of production benefits), and property assessment exemptions. Combined, these can reduce your net cost by 40-60%. We help maximize all available Agawam benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I expand my ground-mount system later?",
      "answer": "Yes! Ground-mount systems are easily expandable. We can design your initial Agawam installation with future expansion in mind, allowing you to add panels as your budget or energy needs grow. This flexibility is a key advantage of ground-mount solar."
