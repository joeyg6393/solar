 ],
 "faq": [
  {
   "question": "How often should I clean my solar panels in Northampton?",
   "answer": "For most Northampton homes, we recommend professional cleaning twice per year - once in late spring after pollen season and once in late fall after leaf drop. However, systems near trees, agricultural areas, or high bird activity may benefit from quarterly cleaning. We can assess your specific situation during our initial consultation."
  },
  {
   "question": "Will cleaning really increase my energy production?",
   "answer": "Absolutely. Studies show that dirty solar panels can lose 15-30% of their efficiency. In Northampton, where we experience significant pollen in spring and leaf debris in fall, regular cleaning can restore full production capacity, translating to significant savings on your electricity costs over time."
  },
  {
   "question": "Is it safe to clean solar panels yourself?",
   "answer": "We strongly recommend professional cleaning for rooftop systems due to fall hazards and the risk of damaging panels with improper techniques or tools. DIY cleaning with incorrect water quality, pressure, or brushes can scratch anti-reflective coatings or even crack panels, voiding warranties."
  },
  {
   "question": "What cleaning method do you use?",
   "answer": "We use a purified deionized water system with specialized soft brushes designed specifically for photovoltaic panels. This method removes all contaminants without leaving mineral deposits or spots, and without using any chemicals that could damage panels or harm the environment around your Northampton home."
  },
  {
   "question": "Do you offer maintenance contracts?",
   "answer": "Yes! Our seasonal maintenance programs include scheduled cleanings (typically spring and fall), priority scheduling, discounted rates, and detailed production monitoring. These programs are popular with Northampton homeowners who want hassle-free solar maintenance throughout the year."
  },
  {
   "question": "What if you damage my panels during cleaning?",
   "answer": "We carry comprehensive liability insurance and have never damaged a panel in over 12 years of service. Our technicians are extensively trained in proper solar panel care. In the extremely unlikely event of damage, our insurance would cover all repairs or replacement costs immediately."
  },
  {
   "question": "Can you clean panels in winter?",
   "answer": "Yes, we can clean panels year-round in Northampton, though we avoid cleaning when panels are covered with snow or ice. Winter cleaning can actually be beneficial after snow melt, as salt and road grime can accumulate on panels, reducing efficiency during the sunny winter days that are valuable for energy production."
